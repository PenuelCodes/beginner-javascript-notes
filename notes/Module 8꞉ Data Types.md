# Module 8: Data Types

## 41 - Objects

In this section of the course we will be learning about objects and arrays. In this video, we will focus on objects.

**Objects** are another fundamental building block of javascript, just like we have strings, numbers and booleans. Actually everything in Javascript is an object, as you soon will see. So, what are they?

Objects allow us to group together properties and values, or keys and values is what we often call it (throughout the course Wes will be saying properties and values). 

Objects have many uses from storing related data to storing functionality, all the way through to creating your own custom types.

Objects are used for when the order of the properties does not matter. That is very important to note. Let's do an example to demonstrate this. Open `objects.html` and add the following code in the body tag:

```
<script>
  const person = {
    name: "wes",
    age: 100
  };
  console.log(person);
</script>
```

Now if we console log the person object, what will we see? We will probably see the object displayed with the properties in the same order. 


![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-07-57-18.png) 1:10

If you modify the code to swap out age and name so age comes first and then console log, you will see that the properties also changed order when we console logged it. However, just because the Javascript interpreter does that, never rely on the properties that you put into the object being in the same order.

### Creating an Object

Typically when you create an object, you are going to open up a curly bracket, and then go ahead and close that curly bracket like so:

```
const person = {
  
};
```

That is called the **object literal** syntax.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-08-00-37.png) 1:30

You can also create an object like this:

```
const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age: 100
});
```

You probably won't see that notation often or ever because the object literal syntax is much cleaner. 
In fact if you wanted to, you could create strings by doing `const name = new String('wes');` but we don't because it's simpler and shorter to use the **string literal syntax**. 

Note: we will talk about the new keyword in coming videos.

Let's talk about some of the keywords related to objects.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-08-04-55.png) 2:31

The property is on the left, and then there is a colon and then we have the value on the right. The values of an object can be any type (string, function, boolean, other objects, arrays etc).

So for example let's say we have a variable, age which is set to 100 like so `const age = 100;`. 

Now we could swap out the harcoded age from our persons object and instead assign it the variable like so:

```
 const age = 100;
const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age: age
});
```

If you console.log the person object now, you will see that age still shows the value of 100. That's a pretty common thing that we'll do. 

Now if you ever run into this situation where the property is the same name as the value variable that you're setting it to, you can simply get away with simply doing writing age like this:

```
 const age = 100;
const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age
});
```

Age is both the property name and the value because the `age` variable is being used for the `age` property. That is the exact same thing as doing `age: age`.

The properties of an object pretty much follow the same rules as variables and Wes would recommend that you use the same rules as variables. However, you can go a bit further with the properties of an object. For example let's say we added one more property to our persons object..

```
 const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true
});
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-08-13-52.png) 4:07

As you can see, you can have a property with a dash in it, whereas you cannot have variables with dashes in them. 

Similarly you can also have spaces and numbers in your properties like so:

```js
 const person = new Object({
  name:'wes',
  age,
  'cool-dude': true,
  'really cool dude': false,
  '777': true,
});
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-08-15-45.png) 4:29

Also, you might notice that in the console the orders of the properties looks different from our code, which is expected and fine. 

After each property, you might notice that we add a comma. Wes recommends adding a comma after the last property in the object, even if there is nothing that comes after it. That is what is called a **trailing comma** or a **comma dangle**. 

It's not totally necessary, but putting a **trailing comma** on there will make sure that the next time you come around and add in a property, we can easily add it. What happens all the time is if you don't leave a trailing comma, the next time you go to add a property it's very easy to forget to include the comma.

If you forget to add a comma between properties, you will see an error similar to what is shown below. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-02-18-06-00.png) 5:37

Another reason is version control. Let's say someone else is coming in and editing your code. Instead of just adding a new property, they have to edit the line above to add a comma, and even though you only modified the line above by adding a comma, it will show up in git blame that you modified that line of code
 last. Git blame is a git functionality that shows who wrote which line of code. 

It used to be that comma dangles weren't supported, but now all modern browsers do support the comma dangle on object properties. 

Other things you can do is add nested properties or nested objects. For example we can create a property called clothing and assign it a sub object like so:

```
const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
});
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-19-28-22.png) 6:56

As you can see, now our persons object has a nested object called clothing which has shirt and pants properrties. You can nest objects as deep as you could possibly want. 

There is a gotcha about copying or cloning objects which we will talk about in just a second. 

You can add new properties to an object even after it has been created. You would use the dot notation to do that. For example if we wanted to add a job property to the person object we could simply add this line of code: `person.job = 'Web Developer'`

Now if you were to take a look at it in the console, you will see the job property has been added and is now part of the object. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-19-32-22.png) 7:35

Similarly if you were trying to overwrite a property, you could do that as well. For example is you add this line `person.age = 50;` and then refresh the html page and look at the console, you will see that age is now set to 50 even though when creating the object we set it to the variable age which was 100. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-19-36-31.png) 7:52

You might have noticed that the person object is a const variable, however we just went ahead and changed part of it. 

That is a gotcha in javascript. Const does not mean that the value of an object cannot be changed. Const means that the binding to that person cannot be changed. What does that mean?

To explain, let's rename the person variable to Wes. You code should now look like this:

```
const age = 100;
const wes = new Object({
name: "wes",
age,
"cool-dude": true,
"really cool": false,
"777": true,
dog: "snickers",
clothing: {
  shirts: 10,
  pants: 2
}
});
wes.job = "Web Developer";
wes.age = 50;
console.log(person);
```

Think about it like this.. Wes is Wes, he has been born and this object represents properties about him. Those properties can change as he grows up, however no one can ever replace him. No one can ever overwrite the binding to him. 

No one could ever come by and say "oh a new Wes was born" and create an object like this further down in the code:

```
wes = {
name: 'Westopher',
age: 12,
job: 'Web Master'
}
```

You can't do that. 

If you refresh the html page and open the console, you will see this error 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-19-54-54.png) 9:00

Even if you put the keyword const infront of the second wes object, you will still get an error that says 
>Identifier 'wes' has already been declared.

That won't work because the binding to 'wes' has already been created. Even though properties on the wes object can change, the actual object itself will can never be overwritten entirely. 

If you do ever want to freeze the values in an object, what you can do is create a frozen object. You use the captial "O" Object and call `.freeze()` on it and pass the object to it that you want to freeze.

Add the following code at the bottom of the script tag:

```
const wesFroze = Object.freeze(wes);
```

That won't freeze the original object wes, but what it will do is return a new object, called `wesFroze` and that can never be changed. 

To demonstrate this, refresh the HTML page and then type wesFroze in the console. That should return the object. Now type in `wesFroze.age = 100` to try to overwrite the age, and hit enter (it should return 100). Now type in wesFrozen again and the object should be returned to you and the age property should still be set to 50. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-20-03-21.png) 9:57 

So if you ever want to make an object so it cannot be changed, you could do that with `Object.freeze()`. 

The word in programming that we use to describe something that cannot be changed is **immutable**. **Mutation** is changing a value. 

### Accessing Properties

Wes has already shown us one way to access properties, which is using the dot notation. For example to access the job property you would write `wes.job` which would return "Web Developer".

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-03-20-07-10.png) 10:35

stopped at 10:35

Just like when we looked at DOM elements, we have getters and setters, objects. That is the exact same thing with an object. In fact, a DOM element is just an object with a bit of extra functionality added to it. 

That is the first way, and that is typically the approach you will use in almost every use case. 

However, we have this other notation to access properties and that is with **square brackets**. 

Similarly to how you can access the property using the dot notation you can also use **square brackets**. You simply write the object name then a set of square brackets, and between the square brackets you give the property name in strings, like so: 

```js
console.log(wes.age);
console.log(wes["age"]);
```

Why do we have that? That seems like a much uglier way to access the properties. There are a few reasons. 

One reason is that this method allows us to pass a variable that is a string type to the square brackets instead of passing a string directly. Let's do an example. 

In the `person` object, add another property like so: 

```
const wes = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  propertyToCheck: "NEVER",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
});
```

Remove the square bracket console log we added above and add the following code instead:

```
console.log(wes.age);
const propertyToCheck = prompt("What do you want to check?");
console.log(propertyToCheck);
console.log(wes[propertyToCheck]);
```

As you can see, instead of passing `"age"` to the square brackets, we are passing the `propertyToCheck` variable instead. The value of propertyToCheck is assigned to whatever we enter into the prompt. Refresh the html page and you should see the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-17-57-58.png) 12:27

If you open the console and then enter a proerty into the prompt such as age, you will see the value is logged. For example, if you were to type in clothing, it gives you the object that is the clothing. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-17-59-38.png) 12:32 

That is one reason: when the property of the object is stored in a variable, because you can't just write `wes.propertyToCheck` because the code will literally look for a property named `propertyToCheck` on the object, it will not be able to interpret that it is a variable. Let's test this out.. add the following line of code and refresh the HTML page:

```
console.log(wes.propertyToCheck);
```

You should see the word "NEVER" logged in the console. Wes asked us to add that property earlier to demonstrate this: if you use the dot notation, the code will assume you are looking for a property with that name, and it will not know it's a variable. If the property name is stored in a variable, you must use square brackets.

There is another reason, which sometimes the properties of your object are not referenceable via Javascript, you have to use a string. 

Comment out the following code as demonstrated below and refresh the html page. 

```js
//const propertyToCheck = prompt("What do you want to check?");
//console.log(propertyToCheck);
//console.log(wes[propertyToCheck]);
```

In the console, you can write `wes.age` and the age will be returned, however you CANNOT type `wes.cool-dude` for example because they are invalid property lookups. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-09-10.png) 13:39

So if that is the case for all three of those properties, (`777`, `really cool`, `cool-dude`) you would have to use square bracket notation to access them. 

So why is that there if it's not really a good idea? Well sometiems you get data that comes from another language, or you get data that comes from server side. If that's the case, you don't really have a whole lot of options so you have to use the square bracket notation in order to reference it.

To reference multiple levels deep, it's the same. For example you would write `wes.clothing.pants` to return the value of the pants property within the children object that is nested within the wes object. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-13-12.png) 14:26

The only gotcha there is if you try to access a property on an object that does not exist, such as `wes.jobs`, it will evaluate to undefined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-13-53.png) 14:41

However, if you try to access a nested property on a property that does not exist, it will throw an error:  

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-15-41.png) 14:50

This is a very common error:

>VM181:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'main' of undefined
>    at <anonymous>:1:10

That is because there is no property that exists on that undefined value. Because `wes.jobs` is undefined, there are no properties that live inside of that. 

If that is the case, the you have to write the following to not throw an error:

```
wes,jobs ? wes.jobs.side : 'Jobs doesn't exist`;
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-19-58.png) 15:#0

There is a proposal and hopefully it will be out soon, which will allow us to do a deep check. It will allow us to do something like this  `wes?.jobs?.side`.

What that would do is the code would say does `wes` object exist? if so, check is the `jobs` property exists, if so, get the value of `side`. That would allow us to do many layers deep. 

It is often the case that we have to write code like this to safely check for the existence of a nested property:

```js
if(wes && wes.jobs ** wes.jobs.first){

}
```

Sometimes we don't know if any of the properties exist and instead have to check one by one or else we will run into the "cannot read property of undefined" error. 

NOTE: This currently does not exist. If you wish to see the status of it, search "Optional Chaining MDN".

We will often use an if statement like that when we are using inputs. To demonstrate, add the following code right after the opening body tag:

```html
<body>
<input type="text" name="first">
```

If you refresh the HTML page, you will see the input on the page: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-25-38.png) 16:58

Often what happens is we will try to select that input from the form like so:

```
  const nameInput = document.querySelector('[name="first"]');
  const name = nameInput.value;
  console.log(name);
```

We are going to set a value on the input so that it is there on page load. Modify the code like so:

```html
 <input type="text" name="first" value="Wes" />
```

When you refresh the page, you should see wes in the console. 
However, if you comment out that input and then refresh the page, you will get an error "cannot read property value of null". 

Why does that happen? 

Because we are assigning to the variable `nameInput` an html element that does not exist so `nameInput` is null. And then it checks for a property called `.value` on it. So if that were the case, and you run into this all the time, you had to do the following:

```
if (nameInput) {
  const name = nameInput.value;
}
```

However there we are making a scoped const variable which isn't very useful because it cannot be used outside the if block. To fix that you could do:

```js
const name = nameInput? nameInput.value : '';
```

That code is first checking whether nameInput exists. If it does, it gets the `value` property on it, and if it doesn't, the name variable evaluates to an empty string.

### Deleting a Property from an Object

To delete a property object you use the delete keyword. 

For example `delete wes.job;` will delete the job property. If you are curious if it worked or not, you can save the result in a variable or simply console log it and a delete will either return true or false based on whether it is deleted or not. 

Add the following code:

```
console.log(delete wes.job);
```

Now if you take a look, you will see it is undefined.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-39-42.png) 19:19

Sometimes you will also see people setting values to be null or undefined. For example `wes.age = undefined;` or `wes.age = null;`. Those are not deleting the properties, they are simply setting them to be null or undefined (in some frameworks that will allow the code to just skip over it).

In an uncoming video, we will cover **loops** and **looping**. It is a pretty common thing to want to loop over the data that is in an object or an array. 


### Methods 

Now, let's talk about methods. We have already talked a lot about this. As we went over earlier, the difference between a method and a function is that a method is just a function that lives inside of an object. That is all we have learned so far. 

If we go back to our 'wes' object and add a property called `sayHello`, we can set it to a function, and that function could take in a greeting if you want (the funtion works the smae as any function that you would have) and from that we could return the greeting in a string and then the name like so:


```
const wes = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  propertyToCheck: "NEVER",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  },
  sayHello: function(greeting = "Hey") {
    return `${greeting} ${this.name}`;
  }
});

```

Now if you fresh the page, open the console and type in `wes.sayHello()` you should see "Hey wes" in the console. 

You can also try passing in a greeting like so: `wes.sayHello('Hello');`  which would return "Hello wes". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-46-34.png) 21:04

You may be working what is the `this` keyword that we use in the `sayHello` function when we call `${this.name}`. Like we have mentioned in the past, when you take a look at a method, and if you look to the left of the dot, `this` will always be equal to the left of the dot.

So in our case, `${this.name}` is going to be equal to "wes" because that is the value of the `name` property on our object. You can access the other properties using the this keyword too. 

The reason we use the `this` keyword instead of using `${wes.name}` within the `sayHello` function is because when we get into prototyping, you are going to see how you can use methods like `sayHello` on multiple people rather than just on a person named wes. 

We could create a person object that is a new instance of Wes or Scott and Kate etc. In that case, the `sayHello` method will exist on all of them, and we can reference the current person's name using `${this.name}`.

We will go into that a lot more in the future once we go into prototypes. For now, just know that when you have a function as a property on an object, that is referred to as a method of that object.

There also is a method shorthand similarly to how instead of having to write `age:age` for the age property we were able to just write `age`, the shorthand for the function consist of taking the function keyword away and the colon like this:

```
const wes = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  propertyToCheck: "NEVER",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  },
  sayHello(greeting = "Hey") {
    return `${greeting} ${this.name}`;
  }
});
```

That is just a shorthand, it does the exact same thing. It is **not** an arrow function.

However, you can add arrow functions. Let's add another property called `sneeze` like so:

```
sneeze: () => {
  console.log("AHHHH CHOOO");
}
```

That is still a method, however because it is an arrow function as a property on an object, we do not have access to the this keyword.

If you also try to console log the `this` keyword like so, you will see it evaluates to Window. 

```js
sneeze: () => {
  console.log("AHHHH CHOOO", this);
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-55-17.png) 22:58

If you were to change that, to a regular function, `this` would be equal to wes. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-04-18-56-31.png) 23:05

We will go into why that is later but the short answer for now is that arrow functions do not scope this to the thing they are called against, and the parent scope will inherit that. 

That is a high level overview of what objects are. In the next few videos we will get deeper into things you need to know, such as little gotchas before we can then dive into arrays.

## 43 - Object Reference vs Values

An important thing to understand in Javascript is the difference between a reference and a value. 

We will use an example to highlight the differences.

Let's say we have the following two variables, both assigned the value of 'wes':

```
let name1 = 'wes';
let name2 = 'wes';
```

We can check if those variables are equal by adding this line of code `conosole.log(name1 === name2);`, which should return true because both values are identical in both value and type. 

However, what if we assign `name1` the value of scott, and then check if they are equal like so? 

```
let name1 = 'wes';
let name2 = 'wes';

console.log(name1 === name2);
name1 = 'scott';
console.log(name1 === name2);
```

That will return false, which is no surprise. 
Now, the question is, what if you set name1 to equal name2 like so? `name1= name2;`. 

Now if you console log again to check the comparison, it will return true. If you check the value of each variable, `name1` and `name2` will both return "wes". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-14-43-10.png) 1:18

If you were to take name2 and set it to name1, that is the same thing, both values would still equal "wes", like so:

`name2 = name1;` 1:28

Now the question is, if you change name2, like so `name2 = 'westopher';`, will name1 and name2 still be equal? We can check what both variables evaluate to by typing them into the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-14-49-10.png) 1:43

You will notice that `name1` is still "wes" while `name2` is "westopher", because we have not updated `name1`. 

So there are a couple of things to note in this excercise: 
 
1. The triple equals checks that both the type and the value are identical.

2. When we set one string variable to be another, the value is copied from one to another. Meaning that when we take `name1` and set it to `name2` (`name1 = name2;`), it just takes the value of `name2` and pastes it to `name1`. So when you update one of the variables, the one pointing to it does not update itself. You may be saying duh, obviously, that's how variables work. But now we will go over how that works for objects, because the example we did was with a string.

Let's demonstrate this with an object now. 

Create a `person1` variable and assign to it an object with first and last properties like so:

```
const person1 = {
  first: "wes",
  last: "bos"
};
```

Duplicate that code by copy and pasting and renaming the variable to `person2`. The only thing we want to change is `person2`. 

```
const person1 = {
  first: "wes",
  last: "bos"
};
const person2 = {
  first: "wes",
  last: "bos"
};
```

If you refresh the HTML page and open the console, if you try typing in `person1 === person2` you will see it is returning false. 
Why?

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-17-54-59.png) 3:01

You be thinking "it's the exact same object. It's an objects with the same contents inside of it, so why are we getting false when we are checkign them?". 

That is because when you are comparing objects, it is done by reference to the object itself, not the values inside of it. That means if they are two totally separate objects, they simply have the contents by change. So in our example, `person1` and `person2` are both objects but they are not the same, even though the contents inside of them are the same, they are not the same object. 

That is different from the contents of a string because a string can only have a value whereas an object and, as we will learn, arrays can have multiple things inside of them, whether they are property and values, or whether they are just straight up items.

Next thing we need to know about objects is that if you make a new person object like so:

```
const person3 = person1;
```

If refresh the HTML page and look at person3 in the console, you should see the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-19-27-38.png) 4:17

Now if you go ahead and update person3's name as demonstrated below, what will you see in the console when we log `person3.first`?

```
const person3 = person1;
person3.first = 'Larry';
console.log(person3.first);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-19-29-28.png) 4:34

You get Larry.

However, what if we console log `person1.name` as shown below? 

```js
const person1 = {
    first: "wes",
    last: "bos"
  };
  const person2 = {
    first: "wes",
    last: "bos"
  };
const person3 = person1l 
person3.first = 'Larry';
console.log(person3.first);
console.log(person1.first);
```

If you look at the person1 object, we have set "wes" as first and "bos" as last. So `person1.first` should be Wes, right?

WRONG! It returns Larry. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-09-03.png) 4:49 

If you try typing `person1`, `person2`, and `person3` in the console, you should see the following returned:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-20-27.png) 5:03

What is going on there? We just updated `person3`, but for some reason, person1 was updated as well. 

In the console, let's try updating `person3.last` like so: `person3.last = 'Cool'`. So `person3.last` should now return "Cool", but what about `person1`? 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-22-30.png) 5:23

So what the heck!? Why is `person1` being updated? The reason that it happens is a fundamental concept of Javascript, that will come and bite you in the butt if you don't understand it. 

The reason that it happens is that when objects and arrays are copied by reference, (like we did with `const person3 = person1;`), we are not taking a copy of it. We are simply creating a variable that references, or points to, the original variable instead of making a copy of it. 

That can lead to unexpected bugs down the road because you might think you're simply creating a copy of it, and then modifying it, but you are not. `person3` was never it's own object, it was just pointing at the original object.
The same thing works with Arrays and Maps and Sets which we will learn in the future. 

So what are your options as a developer when you want to take a copy instead of referencing? There are a couple of different ways you can copy and object. The easiest way to copy something is via something called a **spread**. 

A **spread** is a three dot operator and it's used for taking every single item in a object and spreading it into a new object. 
So instead of doing `const person3 = person1;`, you would do something like this:

```js
const person3 = { ...person1 };
```

What we are doing there is we are assigning the variable `person3` to a new object using the object literal syntax, and then using the spread operator within the object literal to copy person1. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-29-15.png) 7:14

If you console.log `person3`, you will see that it has the same properties as person1. That is because the spread operator will take every single item that is in an object and spread it into the next object. 

There is another way to do this, which is not as popular since spread has been introduced, but previously a lot of people used this method. You call `Object.assign()`, and start with an empty object, and then fold in the other object into it.

```js
const person3 = Object.assign({}, person1);
```

You probably won't see that all that much but if you do, know that is a way to take a copy of an object just like the spread. 

So if you use the spread operator and then try to change the value of `person3.first` to Larry, like so, what would you get? 

```
const person3 = {...person1};
person3.first = 'Larry';
```

If you refresh the HTMl page and then console.log `person3.first` and `person1.first`, you will see that only the value of `person3.first` was updated. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-33-24.png) 8:15

That is because this time we used the spread operator which gave us a copy of the person1 object, and not a reference like we did earlier. 

One thing to do note is that the spread operator only goes one level deep. That means that if we went up to `person1` and added a clothing object, then took a copy of that in person3 like so:

```
const person1 = {
  first: "wes",
  last: "bos",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
};
const person3 = {... person1};
person3.first = Larry;
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-49-16.png) 8:59

If you try to update  `person3.clothing.shirts = 100;` and then view the object in the console, you will notice that `person3.clothing.shirts` does equal 100. However if you look at `person1`, you will notice that `person1.clothing.shirts` was also updated to be 100.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-49-53.png) 9:11

We have the same problem. `person1.clothing.shirts` was also updated even though Wes just told us we can take a copy of an object with a spread operator. So what we need to take away from that is that the spread operator and the `Object.assign()` operator, they do what is called a **shallow** copy, meaning that they will only ever go one level deep when copying. 

If you do want to do a **deep clone** or a **deep copy** of an object, of all of the properties, there are a number of different ways to do it. 

The most popular way is most likely to use something called a **utility library**. 


### Lodash 

Wes most often uses https://lodash.com. 

Lodash is a library that you can include into your script. 

It has a lot of methods that are used when working with objects and arrays. One of those is for doing copies of objects. Let's take a look at the documentation by searching for the keyword clone on the website. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-20-57-56.png) 10:28

Based on the documentation we can see that `_.clone(value)` creates a shallow clone of a value. The documentation also provides an example of how to use the method. You would use it by calling  `_.`, which is where all the lodash methods live, and then calling `.clone()`.  That will just do a high level clone like we did with the spread operator earlier, so there is not much value in that.

There is another method called `_.cloneDeep`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-21-04-35.png) 11:00

Clone deep will also take a copy of any nested objects for us. 

How do you use that? Wes likes to use something called UNPKG (https://unpkg.com). If you navigate to `https://unpkg.com/lodash`, it will load the latest lodash, so we can just take that url and go up above the script that we need and add it. When you're loading Javascript that other code is dependent on, you need to load that first. 

Add the following within the body, after the input:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.js"></script>
```

Now if you type `_.` in your console, you will see that all of the lodash values are available to us.

Later when we cover modules, Wes will show us how to load just the ones you need, because it's unlikely you will need every method in the library but for simplicities sake, we are loading the entire library now. 

Further down in our code `const person3 = {... person1};`, where we were copying, comment that line out. Underneath it add:

```
const person3 = _.cloneDeep(person1);
person3.first = 'Larry';
person3.clothing.shirts = 100;
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-22-42-28.png) 12:29

As you can see, `person1.clothing.shirts` still equals 10, because we performed a deep clone using the lodash method and then modified the value only for the `person3` object because `person3` was no longer a reference to `person1`. 

Wes doesn't reach for this a lot of the time but that is mostly because the stuff he does can just be done by Javascript, but when you do have to do harder things like a deep clone, you can reach for a lodash method. 

Lodash also has methods for working with arrays. 

The `...` spread operator is also helpful when working with merging objects. 

To demonstrate that, we will do an example. Add the following code:

```
const meatInventory = {
  bacon: 2,
  sausage: 3.
};

const veggieInventory = {
  lettuce: 5, 
  tomatoes: 3,
};
```

So we have these two objects: `meatInventory` and `veggieInventory`, both of which have two properties each.

Now we want to merge these two objects and the easiest way to do that is to just make a new variable, an object literal, the dot dot dot followed by one of the objects you want to merge, and then a comma followed by a dot dot dot of the next object you want to merge, as so on, like so: 

```
const inventory = {...meatInventory, ...veggieInventory};
```

You can spread in as many objects as you want.

Now we have a new inventory property which you can see if you refresh the page, open the console and type in `inventory`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-22-49-53.png) 13:41

You can also put some objects on their own line and add your own values in. 

For example you could do:

```
const inventory = {
  ..meatInventory, 
  ...veggieInventory,
  oysters: 10,
  };
```

And you can see that oysters will be added to it.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-22-51-03.png) 13:58

You can mix and match the spreading. 
The only thing you really need to know about that is if there are duplicates (for example oyster could be an oyster mushroom or an oyster from the sea),  which one will win out?

Let's say we added oyster to `meatInventory` AND `veggieInventory` like so:

```
const meatInventory = {
  bacon: 2,
  sausage: 3.
  oyster: 10,
};

const veggieInventory = {
  lettuce: 5, 
  tomatoes: 3,
  oyster: 15,
};
const inventory = {
  ..meatInventory, 
  ...veggieInventory,
  };
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-22-53-06.png)  14:30

`oyster:15` wins out. Why? Because `veggieInventory` comes after in the spread, so the order of the spread does matter in this case. Similarly, if you were to type in:

```
const inventory = {
  ..meatInventory, 
  ...veggieInventory,
  bacon: 10,
  };
```

Bacon would be 10 because it would overwrite the value in the `meatInventory`.

Wes really likes the spread operator. It can also be used for arrays which we will learn about in the arry lessons. 

The last thing we are going to hammer home is that the concept of passing in via reference vs copy also applies to functions. 

So if you had a function `doStuff`, which took in an argument called data, and within the function we modified the value of data to be somethign else, like so:

```
function doStuff(data){
  data = 'something else';
}
```

ALl this function does is take in an argument, and changes that data for whatever reason. 

Now if we were to run that function and pass it our name1 variable which was set to "wes" way up in the code, if we were to take a look at that and console.log the data like so:

```
function doStuff(data){
  data = 'something else';
  console.log(data);
}
doStuff(name1);
```

If you refresh the page and type in `name1` in the console, it should still return "wes". What that means is when you passed in the `name1` variable to `doStuff`, you were only passing in the value of "wes", it doesn't actually reference to the external variable (which is good!).

Now, let's do that again with an object:

```js
function doStuff2(data){
  data.tomatoes = 1000000000l
  console.log(data);
}

doStuff(inventory);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-23-01-18.png) 16:39

If you refresh the page and look in the console, you will see the value of data logged as shown above. 

However, if you type in `inventory`, which is the object that lives outside of the `doStuff2` function, you will see that it also contains the tomatoe property.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-06-23-03-08.png) 16:50

That means that if you pass in an object to a function, and you modify that object, the external object will also be updated.

That is not the case for booleans, numbers and strings, but it is the case for objects and strings. 

That means that if you modify an object or an array that is passed into a function inside of the function, know that you may be accidentally modifying data that lives outside of it. That is a huge source of bugs, because when you pass in data as a reference, you may be unknowingly modifying data that lives outside of that function.

If that is the case, you make sure you pass it in as a copy. It may be the case that you want to modify external data, but sometimes you don't and it leads to bugs. 

---

## 44 - Maps

In the `/playgrounds` folder, open up `maps.html`. We are going to learn about this thing called a **map**. It is very similar to an object, however there are a couple of key differences.

We will cover: how does it work, what does it do and lastly why you would want to use one over an object or how to decide whether to use a map or an object.

The way you create a map is using the `new` keyword followed by `Map()` with a capital M.  

```
const myMap = new Map();
```

In order to add items to a map, we have the following APIs:
- set `.set()`
- has `.has()`
- delete `.delete()`

We will go through all of them. 

#### Set

Firstly, you take `myMap` and you `set()` it, to which you pass two arguments. The first is going to be what the key of the map will be, so let's call it a 'name' and then we set the value of it. 

```
myMap.set('name', 'wes');
console.log(myMap);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-08-12-05.png) 1:06

As you can see in the console, we have our map and it gives us our entries, entries are the actual values in the map.

Now if you were to use the object notation that we are used to, something like `myMap.age = 100;`, you will notice that it's not actually added in the same spot. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-08-14-47.png) 1:33 

It is in the map, but it is a property on the map, not an actual entry in our map. 

So why is this useful?

Well, there are a couple of nice things about this API, apart from the fact that we have a `.set()` method and a `.has()` method and a `.delete()` method, one big benefit of a map is the keys can be any type other than just using a string or an allowed variable name. 

So instead of passing name as the key when we called `.set()` on `myMap`, we could pass a number like `myMap.set(100, 'This is a number');`

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-08-17-27.png) 2:09

As you can see, the entry has a key of 100. 

Previously we have only had the ability to add different types in the value portion of an object.

A map allows us to put any value into the key and into the value (any type of value). Now why is that useful? 

In Javascript, we have these things called dictionaries. A dictionary is just a way to store additional metadata about something else. 

What is a dictionary in real life? Well, if you have word, that word does not contain all the information about how to pronounce it, what it means, whether it's a verb or a noun, etc. All of that information about that word is not stored in the word, it's stored somewhere else, which is a dictionary and if we want to look that information up, we use the dictionary. 

Let's create a variable `person1` like so:

```
const person1 = {
  name: 'wes',
  age: 200
}
```

What we can do is use the reference to that object as a key in your map to store additional information inside of your map. 

In `maps.html`, we are going to use the reference to the `person1` object as a key in our map, and let's say as the value we will store a string about how cool the person is (this could really be anything, does not have to be a string). 

Add the following at the end of the script tag but before we console log `myMap`. 

```
myMap.set(person1, 'Really cool');
console.log(myMap);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-03-58.png) 3:53

Now if you open up our map, you will see that the key is actually an object and the value is really cool.

That is useful because let's say at a later point in time we wanted to look that up in our dictionary, we could add the following code to grab the value: 

```
myMap.get(person1);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-07-07.png) 4:22

What we have done there is instead of putting a unique string, or an ID or something else, we simply use the reference to the object as the key in the map to store the additional information. 

Note: all values in a map can be any type, just like the key. 

Another example we can do is let's say someone has a score that they want to add additional information to. 

```
const score = 100;
```

On the map, we want to set additional information on the map about what prizes they will win at that score. We will create a new map for this. 

```
const score = 100;
const prizes = new Map();
prizes.set(100, 'Bear');
prizes.set(200, 'Duck');
prizes.set(300, 'Car');
```

Now if this was an object, we could have had to use a string of the number in order to look it up. However in this case, we can just use the number to look at what the corresponding prize is. 

Add a console log after the last set on our map:

```
console.log('you win a ${prizes.get(score)}`);
```

Now if you refresh the page, you will see the following in the console:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-11-12.png) 6:07

In a lot of the real world exercises we will build, we will pause and go over whether or not it makes sense to use an object or a map for our situation, so you can get used to when to reach for one versus the other.

So far we have covered how to set and get values of a map. You can also get the siez of a map using `.size`. If you type `myMap.size` in the console, you it should return 3. This is very similar to getting the length of something. 

The other thing about a map is that order **is** guaranteed. Unlike an object, with a map, the order in which you put things into your map is the order at which they will stay. That is very important if you need to maintain the order. 

Let's do an example to demonstrate displaying the prizes using objects vs maps. 

Within the body tag, but before the script tag, add the following code: 

```HTML
<ul class="prizes"></ul>
```

Now let's say we wanted to loop over the prizes in our map and display what you get for which point value, it's important that they go into that order. 
With an object, they could be jumbled. It would be weird to display the prizes in non-ascending or descending order. But when you use a map, it's guaranteed to maintain order.

Now what we can do is select the ul, loop over all the entires in our map (there is a couple of different ways we can do that which we will cover in the looping and iterating lesson), and we are going to get an entry and console log it to start. 

```
//select that ul
const ul = document.querySelector('.prizes');
prizes.forEach(entry=>{
  console.log(entry);
})
```

if you refresh the page and look at the console, you will see Bear, Duck and Car, in that order.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-18-01.png) 8:25

However, that only gives us the value. If we want to return the key and value, we can use the `for of` loop. 

```
const ul = document.querySelector('.prizes');

for(const prize of prizes){
  console.log(prize);
}

```

This is getting a bit ahead of ourselves with the looping but just know that we are looping over all the entires in the map, one by one, and for each one we are going to create a temporary variable called prize and we are going to log it. 

 ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-20-00.png) 8:57

 Now as you see, we get an array and that array's first item will be the key and the second item will be the values. 

 Now we can modify our console.log to instead be:

 ```
 console.log(prize[0], prize[1]);
 ```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-21-04.png) 9:15

We can go further and destructure the array. That will allow us to instead of referencing it by it's index, we can create variables of the items in there by their index.

Modify the code like so:

```
for(const [points, prize] of prizes){
  console.log(points,prize);
}
```

If you refresh the HTML page and look at the console you will notice it works the exact same. The only difference is now  we have two variables, one for points and one for prize, rather than accessing the values using the array and their index. 

Note: you coudl have rename points and prize to anything you wanted.. for example `for(const [key, value] of prizes)` would have worked just as well.

Modify the code again like so to display the score:

```
for(const [points, prize] of prizes){
  const li = `<li>${points} - ${prize}</li>`;
  ul.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend;, li);
}
```

Now when you refresh the page, you should see the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-26-42.png) 10:56

hWen do you use a map over an object?

You should use a map if you do need to maintain the order of your items. 

One downside to a map is there is no literal, meaning that you always have to create a new map that way and then set the items in it. 

You can pass items into your map with an array or arrays, but it's kind of weird. 

Let's do an example. You pass in an array of arrays. So you have an array which contains many arrays separated by commas like so

```
new Map( [[1,2], [3,4]])
```

If you type that in the console you will see:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-29-00.png) 11:46

As you can see there, we have created a map. That's a bad example, let's do something else.

```
new Map([['name', 'wes'], ['age', '49']])
```

You can pass an array of multiple arrays where the first item is the key and the second item is the value. However, the object literal syntax is a little bit neater of an API. 

Wes didn't show us delete. 
In the console, if you still haven;t refreshed from our previous example, type `myMap.delete('name')`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-32-07.png) 12:25

If you type `myMap`, you will notice that the name entry is gone. 

Another thing about an object is you can put functions inside of an object and we call those methods. You cannot do that with a map, that is not what they are for. They are simply for storing data.

The last thing is we have this thing called **JSON**. Wes hasn't explained it to us yet but he is going to try really quickly. 

Let's say you have an object:

```
const person = {
  name : 'wes', 
  age: 100
}
```

And you want to send that object to somebody, you would turn it into text. Text is easily sent via servers, from one website to another. Anytime you want to transfer an object or an array, you have to first convert that to a portable format. 

This one way that all programming languages understand is JSON. You can turn an object into json using `JSON.stringify()`. It takes in one argument, which is the object you want to convert. 

It takes the object and converts it into a string, which you can send very easily, and then the person on the other end can turn it back into an object using something like

```
JSON.parse(`{"name":"wes","age":"100"}`)
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-37-25.png) 13:59

JSON stands for **Javascript Object Notation**. However it has been implemented by every single language out there. 

JSON is amazing, however, if you have a map, currently JSON does not handle maps. 

If you try `JSON.stringify(myMap)` you will see the following error and get an empty object because it is not aware of maps yet. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-19-38-54.png) 14:53

There is this thing called JSON 5 which is trying to improve JSON but until that is ready, if you want to send your map content you have to convert it to an object currently. 

You can do that using `Object.fromEntries(myMap)`, which tries it's best to convert it to a regular object. However, you will see if you use any of the benefits of a map, it falls apart when you turn it into JSON. 

We will try to use both of them in our examples but Wes personally uses objects much more frequently, but he thinks map will start to catch on in the next couple of years.

## 45 - Arrays

In this video we will be learning about arrays: how to create them, how to add items how to remove items, things like that.

In the next video we will cover looping over an array. 

What is an array? 
An array is used for holding a list of items where the order matters.

Each thing inside of the array is called an **item** and it's position in the array is called an **index**. 

To repeat: the thing is called an **item** and where it remains in the array is called an **index**. 

The number of items inside of an array is called a **length**. 

Each item inside of an array can be any type. It can be: a string, a number, a boolean, an object, another array, a nested array, you name it. 

In the `/playgrounds` directory, open up `arrays.html`. 

Add a script tag inside the body tag (if it's not already there).

We will use an example of a list of names to demonstrate how to create an array. 

Whereas curly brackets are for an object, square brackets `[]` are used for noting you are creating an array or an *array literal**. 

```js
const name = [];
```

You can also create an array using the longhand, just like you can with a string, a number, an object etc, like so:

```js
const names = new Array();
```

To create items inside of an array you can simply do this:

```js
const names = ['wes','kait','snickers'];
```

What we have done there is created an array with 3 items, each of which are separated by a comma. 

Now we can go ahead and open the page up in a browser and take a look at our array in the console.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-20-06-27.png) 1:54

This is our array. It looks a lot like an object, but as you can see, it has no keys, which is sort of the main difference between arrays and objects. 

An array has no keys. The keys will always be the indexes meaning 0,1,2,3,4,5..

One thing to mention is that if you types into the console `typeof names`, you would get "object" returned.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-07-20-08-09.png) 2:20

You might be thinking "Whhaaattt??" typeof names is an object??

You may be thinking back to one of the earlier videos where we went over all the types and remember that we didn't say that array was it's own type. An array is actually just an object at the end of the day, meaning that it can hold data and have a bunch of methods living inside of it. 

If you do need to check whether something is an array, the way you can do that is the following:

```js
Array.isArray(names)
```

That will return true or false depending on whether whatever you pass it (in this case `names`, is an array or not). That is something called a **static method** which we will learn about later. 

So we have the names array, but how do you access things inside of it? Because you can't do something like `names.wes`. That's how you access properties in an object. 

If you want to access things inside of an array, you use the index.

```
console.log(names[1]);
```

Do you think that will return the first item in the array? If you guess yes, you are wrong! 

If you refresh, you will see  "kait". Why? Because arrays are what are referred to as **zero based**. What that means is that the counting starts at 0.

There are two things Wes likes to tell everyone when he is talking about **zero based**. 

First, he went to McDonalds once and was order number zero. And he went to McDonalds another time and he was number 99. It is just so that the number was huge on the receipt, and they had enough space on the receipt to put two numbers but their ordering system did a hundred numbers and then rolled over and started again. 

What they did is instead of going from 1 to 100, because then the order number (100) wouldn't fit on the receipt, they started at 0 to 99 which still gave them the full hundred orders. 

The second story is that when Wes got married is he had a table 0, and the last table was 23. That means they had 24 tables in total, it was zero based so it started at 0. That was very confusing for people working there and he does not recommend it. 

In order to access the first item in an array you use a zero like so:

```
console.log(names[0]);
```

Which should return "wes" because that is the first item in our array.

If you want to check how many items are in an array, we use `.length`. That is NOT zero based. 

If you refresh the html page and look at the console, you should see the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-07-19-02.png) 5:39

So if you want to acess items within the array it is zero based, however if you are using `.length` to check how many items are in the array it is not zero based.

If you want to get the last item in the array, you could `console.log(names[2]);` which would give us snickers, but what if you don't know how long the array is?

Let's say we modified our array to look like this:

```
const names = ['wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'wes', 'kait', 'snickers'];
```
Now we have no idea how many items are there (don't waste your time counting).

When you need to access the last item in the array but do not know how many there are, you can use the length property like so:

```
console.log(names[names.length -1]);
```

If you tried to do `console.log(names[names.length])`, it will return undefined. Why? Because `names[27]` does not have a value, the last item is actually at `names[26]` because the length is 27. 

### Array Methods

The Array prototype is full of useful methods for adding, removing and finding things inside of the array. 

Let's update our names array to onlly contain 3 names again. 

```js
const names = ["wes", "kait", "snickers"];
```

If you refresh the page and take a look at the names array in the console, you should see something like:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-07-27-37.png) 7:47

Those are all methods.. `concat`, `copyWithin`, `push`, `pop`, `findIndex`. There are tons of methods available to use when working with an array. 

We are not going to go over how every single one works, we will go over the more important ones and learning the idea of **immutability**, **mutable** and **immutable**, because Wes believes thats much more important.

Let's talk about the scary words **mutable** and **immutable** again. 

Mutable methods perform mutations. You can think of this like the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles. Why were they mutants? Because they transformed from turtles into teenagers with really cool bandanas. 

When something changes the original version of it, that is what is referred to as a **mutation**. 

**Immutable** methods do not change the original thing, they simply return an new array. 

Let's do some examples. Firt, we will look at a mutation method. 

```
//Mutation Method
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
const numbersBackwards = numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbersBackwards);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-07-50-01.png) 9:46

It gives us the array backwards. Now what if we console.log `numbers`? Will the numbers in that array still be in the right order, will they be reversed or has it been deleted?

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-07-51-03.png) 10:09

The original array has actually been reversed as well. That is what is referred to as a mutation, meaning the original data has been changed from what it was originally set out to be. 

So we don't even need that secondary variable in our example, we could just do 

```js
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers);
```

Mutability is not necessarily bad or incorrect, it's just something important to know about javascript, that some methods will modify the original array, whereas some will create a new array and leave the original one intact.

Most functional programmers or React developers tend to have a mantra of don't actually mutate the original array, create a new version of it. 

So what's an immutable example of one of the methods? Let's take `numbers` and use the `slice()` method. The slice method allows us to take a portion of the array and make it into a new array. 

Let's say we want to take the items at index 2 to index 4. Add the following code, refresh the html page and open the console. 

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
console.log(numbers);
const pizzaSlice = numbers.slice(2, 4);
console.log(pizzaSlice);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-04-47.png) 11:45

What we have done is we have gone from index 2, which is the 3rd item and stopped at index 4, which is the 5th item. Splice returns to use the subset of the original array, based on the index values we pass it. If you ever need to take a chunk out of an array, you can reach for slice.

Now the question is, will the number 3 and 4 still be in the original numbers array? 

Below where we log `pizzaSlice`, add `console.log(numbers);` and refresh the page.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-39-29.png) 12:06

As you can see, numbers is still intact, meaning the number 3 and 4 have not been removed from it.  

That is referred to as **immutable** methods, meaning they do not change the original data. Mutation methods do change the original data. 

This is the cause of a lot of bugs. Just a few weeks ago, Wes forgot that `reverse()` was a mutable method.

So what do you do if you want to use a mutable method but you don't want to actually mutate the original array?

You take a copy of the array! 

Let's demonstrate this with a code example. 

You can copy an array using the square brackets and the spread operator, like so:

```ja
const numbersReversed = [...numbers];
console.log(numbersReversed);
console.log(numbers);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-44-38.png) 13:49 

Now you can go ahead and call `reverse()` on numbers reversed like so:

```
const numbersReversed = [...numbers];
numbersReversed.reverse();
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-47-00.png) 14:01

You can also just call the method immediately on the array that was created like so:

```js
const numbersReversed = [...numbers].reverse();
```

To recap: anytime you want to call a mutable method without mutating the original thing, you should first take a copy of it and then call the method. 

Most of the methods that we will learn about in arrays are immutable, but the few that aren't can getcha. 

Comment out all the numbers code we added, because we will continue with our names example that's towards the top of the script tag.

One thing you will want to do with an array is add items to it. For that, we use the `push()` method. 

```
names.push('lux');
console.log(names);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-54-28.png) 15:11

This does mutate the original array. 

If you didn't want to mutate the original array you could do something like this:

```
const names2 = [...names, 'lux'];
```

What that does is it copies all the items from the names array and then add an additional item, which is "lux".

If you want to add an item to the front of an array, you wouldn't use push, because that adds the item to the back of the array. You would use `unshift()`.

For example:

```
names.unshift('poppy');
console.log(names);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-19-59-52.png) 16:27

The immutable way to do that would be:

```
const names3 = ['poppy', ...names];
```

The next two methods you will mix up for the rest of your life.. those are: `splice()` and `slice()`. 

We have already covered `slice()`, which allows you to take a portion out of the original array. 

But there also is `splice()`. Both are used for grabbing a subset of the array but `slice()` is immutable and `splice()` is mutable.

Let's take a look at both methods on MDN. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-02-49.png) 17:40

 >The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end (end not included) where begin and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.


 What they mean by (end not included) means that in our examples where we did `slice(2,4)`, it took the items start at index 2, but not at index 4. The end is not inclusive. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-05-12.png) 17:59

Splice on the other hand will actually take the item out of the original array. 

>The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.


The other gotcha is that there is no start and end in splice. Splice has a start and then how many you should go for. For example if you want to start at one and delete 5, you would use splice. 

Let's take a look at the numbers example:

```js
console.log(numbers);
numbers.splice(3,2);
console.log(numbers);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-07-38.png) 18:46

So we started at index 3 which was the #4. Then we went for two items, for #4, #5 and took those out of the array. 

That is mutable, whereas slice will just return a new array. 

More often than not you will want to reach for slice because of that. A trick to remember that is that you probably want a slice of pizza, so think of pizza!

Now let's talk about adding items to the middle of an array. 

It is best to use this spread method that we have. 

Let's say we have an array of bikes, and we want to add two items in the middle. How do we do that? There is no method to insert an item at a specific index and have the  rest push over. 

What we can do here is we create a new array, then use the spread operator in combination with slice like so: 

```js
const bikes = ["bianchi", "miele", "panasonic", "miyata"];
const newBikes = [
  ...bikes.slice(0, 2), 
  "benotto", 
  ...bikes.slice(2)
  ];
  console.log(newBikes);
```

We took the first two and spread them into it, then we add our new item, and then we take everything else after that and spread it into there. How do we take everything after an index using splice? You don't pass it an end, like we did here: `...bikes.slice(2);`

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-16-34.png) 22:09

What if you want to remove an item, like panasonic, from the array? 
We would create a new array and use slice like so:
```
const newBikes2 = [
  ...newBikes.slice(0, 3), 
  ...newBikes.slice(4)
  ];
  console.log(newBikes2);
```

So what we are doing there is we are takign everything up until panasonic, so index 0 to 3, then we take everything after panasonic, like so: `..newBikes.slice(4);`

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-19-41.png) 22:45

Panasonic is no longer in our new array.

This is a very common thing to do, especially in frameworks like React and Angular. 

You basically find where that thing is in the array, and then you use it's index to remove it. 

Let's do an example liek that. 

Let's say we have a bunch of comments, and each item in the comments is an object, like so: 

```
const comments = [
  { text: "Cool Beans", id: 123 },
  { text: "Love this", id: 133 },
  { text: "Neato", id: 233 },
  { text: "good bikes", id: 333 },
  { text: "so good", id: 433 }
];
```

Now we may have a function called `deleteComment` which takes in an id and the comments array. 
 

Inside of the function, we first need to find the index of the item in the array, then we need to make a new array without that item in it, and then we have to return our new array. 

One thing we have not covered yet is how do you find the index of something, based on the item you are seraching for? 

You use a method called `findIndex()`.

You might think it would wokr like this: 

```
const kaitIndex = names.findIndex('kait');
console.log(kaitIndex);
```

However, if you try that, you will get the following error:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-27-10.png) 25:13

It's not as easy as that because our structures are going to be a bit more complex than just strings.

In this case, we want to find an object based on it's id. 

If that is the case, we will do something very similar to a loop. `findIndex()` will loop over every single item and then we find the item that we want we will return true and that will give us the index. 

For example:

```
const kaitIndex = names.findIndex(name => {
  if(name === 'kait'){
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
})
console.log(kaitIndex);
console.log(names[kaitIndex])l
```

You should see the index 2 and the value of Kait in the console when you refresh the page. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-30-09.png) 26:12

That method is a bit long, so there is a few shorter way to do it.

One way is that you can remove the else because if it's true, it will return and the else will never run. 

```
 if(name === 'kait'){
    return true;
  }
    return false;
```

The if statement also returns true or false itself so there is no real need for an if statment. 
 
Thus, the other way we can do it is just by  return the condition, which will be true of false like this:

```
const kaitindex = names.findIndex(name => {
  return name === 'kait';
})
```

If you refresh the page, you will see that it still works. 

You can even go one step further and use an implicit return. We get rid of the curly brackets, put it all on one line, getting rid of the semi-colon and the keyword return like so: 

```
const kaitIndex = names.findIndex(name=>name === 'kait');
console.log(kaitIndex);
```
 
Now that we have that, we can make another array like so:

```
const newNamesWithOutKait = [
  //get everything up to the kait index
  names.slice(0,kaitIndex),
  //everything after
  names.slice(kaitIndex + 1)
];
console.log(newNamesWithOutKait);
```

What we are doing there is we go from the start and then grab everything up to the kaitIndex, then we get everything after the kaitIndex.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-37-10.png) 28:19

Whoops! You might notice that it looks weird. We goofed up a bit here. 

What we did accidentally is we created an array of two arrays. We don't want two arrays, we want to take the items out of them and spread them into the new oe like so: 


```
const newNamesWithOutKait = [
  //get everything up to the kait index
  ...names.slice(0,kaitIndex),
  //everything after
  ...names.slice(kaitIndex + 1)
];
console.log(newNamesWithOutKait);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-38-45.png) 28:47

There is a new method in javascript called `.flat()`. 

If you call it directly on `newNamesWithOutKait` it wouldn't work because it's immutable. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-40-10.png) 29:19

We would have to return it liek so:

```
const newNames999 = newNamesWithOutKait.flat();
console.log(newNames999);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-41-15.png) 29:20

You can see it flattened the two arrays into one for us. 

You could also do this:

```
const newNamesWithOutKait = [
  //get everything up to the kait index
  names.slice(0,kaitIndex),
  //everything after
  names.slice(kaitIndex + 1)
],flat();
```

It is a nice solution. 

We will be using the callback API similar to what we used in `findIndex` in a lot of the methods. 

Now we will go back to our deleteComment example and create the function. 

First we will find the index. That is a bit different because this time we are looking for an object where it's ID property matches. 

```
const commentIndex = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === id);
```

Next we will  return a new array using slice. We will get everything before the comment and then everything after the comment. 

```
return [
  ...comments.slice(0, commentIndex),
  ...comments.slice(commentIndex + 1)
];
```

Here is the entire method:

```
function deleteComment(id, comments) {
  // first find the index of the item in the array
  const commentIndex = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === id);
  // make a new array without that item in it
  return [
    ...comments.slice(0, commentIndex),
    ...comments.slice(commentIndex + 1)
  ];
  // return our new array
}
```

Now if you go and refresh the page and type comments into the console, you can see the comments. 

In the console type in `deleteComment(233, comments)` and that will return the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-08-20-46-47.png) 31:40

The original comments are still there, we just made a new array called deleteComments with the item removed.

## 46 - Array Cardio - Static Methods

This is method cardio! This is something that Wes likes to do where we do a bunch of little examples. Instead of Wes sitting there and trying to explain all the different array methods to us, we are just going to do lots of examples. 

You can take a stab at trying each one on your own, then come back and watch Wes do it, and he will talk through how it works. 

Let's look up the MDN docs for arrays. When you open it, you will see all the array methods in the documentation, along the sidebar. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-06-44.png) 00:31

Instead of Wes going through each one, we are going to work with the data Wes has provided and use the methods in examples to add things, remove things and sort things. 

Wes has another course called Javascript30 (it's totally free), and in that course there are two lessons that focus on Array Cardio. So if after this video you want more practice, you can visit those videos. 

Wes has broken this up into different sections.
We have:
- static methods
- instance methods
- callback methods
- looping methods

We are going to start off with the static methods. 

Open up `array-methods-START.html`, which will give you a starting version with data and commented out instructions.

If you look at the sidebar of the array documentation, you will see there are three methods: `Array.from()`, `Array.isArray()` and `Array.of()`

All the rest of the methods have `Array.prototype` and then the method instead of calling the method directly on `Array`. what is the deal with that? 

That is because those three methods are **static methods**, while the rest are referred to as **instance or prototypal** methods.

If you  refresh the HTML page and open the console, we can create an array like so:

```
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
```

We can call pop numbers out, push numbers in, etc. Those are methods sort of just come along whenever you create an array.

Whenever you create an array, you get what is referred to as the array prototype. These are the methods that are on every single array that are available for us to work with on that array. 

Now there are also this thing called **static methods** which aren't available on every single array, but they sort of live on the capital A `Array`. Those are often what Wes refers to as utility methods. They are handy methods for creating or working with arrays. We will also look at some object static methods as well.

The way static methods work are they are NOT a method like `numbers.push(5)`. We call `push()` on the `numbers` array that we created. 

Static methods are called with something like `Array.from()` and they are access like that. Let's go through it.

`Array.of()` is used for creating an array from it's arguments.

For example you could pass it the arguments of 'wes' and 'kait' and it would create an array with those two items, like so: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-29-23.png) 4:00

Wes has never used that in his career, ever, mainly because it's shorter and simpler to create an array usign an array literal. 

There are a coulpe of little edge cases uses for it. One kinda cool this is you can spread into a function. 

We have already covered how when you have something, you can spread into an array, like so:

```
[...'wes'];
Array.of(...'wes');
```
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-31-20.png) 4:34

What the ... does in the example above is it takes an **iterable**, meaning something that has a length, ("wes" is something that has a length because strings have a length), and you can sperad each of the items of that iterable into the surrounding array.

So in the example above, we have spread every letter that makes up wes and put it as an item of the array.

The same things works if you are spreading into a function. For example, if you have a function that takes an unlimited amount of arguments, or you have something where you want to spread each item as argument one, argument two etc. you an spread into a function call. That's what it does, you can use that 

Next let's talk about `Array.from()` which is somethign that Wes uses fairly often.

`Array.from()` will take an **iterable** (something with a length), and most often Wes will give it an object with a length property like so:

```
Array.from({length:10})
```

What that will do is it returns an array from that iterable with that many empty slots.  So in our example, we are saying we want 10 spots, and that returns to us an array with 10 empty spots. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-37-33.png) 5:59

That is really handy because Wes often wants to make an array of numbers 1 through 10 and loop over them and display each items or something like that. Sometimes Wes just wants to loop from 1 to 10 or 5 to 8 and using `Array.from()` will do that. 

`Array.from()` also takes in a secondary argument which is referred to as a map argument. The map function will tell us what we can return to put into those slots. 

Let's do an example.  We will create a variable named range, which will be equal to an array with 10 slots, like so:

```
const range = Array.from({length:10});
```

A second argument from that is a function from which you can return anything. 

Add the following:

```js
const range = Array.from({length:10}, function(){
  return 'wes';
});
```

If you refresh the page, and open the console you should see that all 10 items have a value of "wes". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-49-53.png) 6:59

This callback function will give you the actual item that is in the slot as an argument, as well as the index. For example:

```js
const range = Array.from({length:10}, function(item, index){
  return index';
});
```

What that has done is it has given us an array where each number is the index that we have. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-18-51-40.png) 7:42

We can use this to make a little function that takes in two arguments, start and end:  `createRange(start,end)`. 

We will move the const range variable inside of that function like so:

```
function createRange(start,end){
  const range = Array.from({length:10}, function(item, index){
  return index';
});
}
```

However, we want to change the length value. Instead of 10, we will do the end minus the start like so:

```
function createRange(start,end){
  const range = Array.from({length:end - start}, 
  function(item, index){
    return index';
  });
}
```

Let's test that out by refreshing the HTML page and testing it in the console. 

Add the following in the console:
```
createRange(3,7)
```

You should see the following in the console:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-19-02-07.png) 8:24

Oops! We forgot to return the range. add a return to the function like so:

```
function createRange(start,end){
  const range = Array.from({length:end - start}, 
  function(item, index){
    return index;
  });
return range;
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-19-03-25.png) 8:34

We started at 3 and went to 7, which gave us 4 spots.

Then what we can do is return the index + the start number by modifying the code to instead of returning `index`, to return `index + start` like so:


```
function createRange(start,end){
  const range = Array.from({length:end - start}, 
  function(item, index){
    return index + start ;
  });
return range;
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-09-19-04-38.png) 8:45

If you wanted this to be inclusive of 7, you could add add 1 to where you set the length of array. You change `Array.from({ length: end - start}` to `Array.from({ length: end - start + 1 }`


That is a handy range function which Wes has probably written a dozen times in his career. So that is what Array.from() does, it creates an array given an iterable which is most likely aways going to be an object with a length on it. 


Let's create a range using that function. Add the following line underneath the range function: 

```
const myRange = createRange(3, 7);
```

Let's refresh the HTML page and open the console. Let's try to the following `createRange(3,734223423)`. If you try that, you should get an error like so: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-31-54.png) 9:49

There is a limit to how big your arrays can be. They are very, very, very large. There are some additional datatypes in the language for having big, big arrays, and you will most likely only run into those when you're dealing with 3D graphics and you have to work at a per pixel level.

Let's refresh the page, open the console and try with a smaller number like 

```
createRange(3,7342);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-37-17.png) 10:09

You can see that runs nice and quickly. 

We have looked at `Array.isArray()` before but let's do it quickly.

```js
console.log(Array.isArray(myRange));
```

You should see "true" logged. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-38-47.png) 10:30

That is a pretty common thing you will need to do because if you try to use typeof with an array, it will return "object" because an array isn't a real type. The only way to check whether an array is an array is by using `Array.isArray()` 

Some people sort of cheat it and instead of using `Array.isArray` they will check fo the existence of this that are array-ish such as for the existance of a length property. That isn't good because you could have an object with a length property as well and that check wouldn't work.


#### Object Static Methods

Next up we have these static methods: `Object.entries()`, `Object.keys`, `Object.values()`, which are on the object instead of on the array. However they return arrays, which is why we are covering them here.

This exercise requires us to take the `meats` object and make three arrays with `.entries()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`. 

Here is our meats object:

```
const meats = {
  beyond: 10,
  beef: 5,
  pork: 7,
};
```

If you want to turn this object into an array of keys, or an array of the values, or both, that is where we use these static helper methods. 

You use `Object.entries()` when you want to put both the keys and values into an array like so:

```
console.log(Object.entries(meats));
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-48-26.png) 11:48


Now add the following code below the line where we are logging the entries array:

```js
console.log(Object.entries(meats));
console.log(Object.keys(meats));
console.log(Object.values(meats));
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-50-45.png) 11:58

As you can see, `keys()` is going to give us an array of all the object keys, `values()` will give us an array of all the values and `entries()` is going to give us an array where each item is then a nested second array inside of it where the first item in the nested array is the key and the second item is the value. 

These are pretty common things to do. 

One pretty common way to work with those is using the `forEach`. This is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves because we haven't learned about looping all that much, but Wes will show us how to do it anyway.

So let's say we do the following:

```
Object.values(meats).forEach(qty => {
  console.log(qty);
});
```
If you refresh the HTML page and look at the console you should see the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-56-17.png) 12:53

That is a pretty common thing to do it you want to like loop over and add up how much inventory you have or you want to add up all the numbers, we will look at how we can use `reduce()` to do that. 

The same thing is if we were to do `keys`, instead of getting the quantity we would be grabbing the values and putting them into an array and then looping over them. 

```js
Object.keys(meats).forEach(qty => {
  console.log(qty);
});
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-58-33.png) 13:13

Now let's try entries:

```
  Object.entries(meats).forEach(entry => {
    console.log(entry);
  });
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-12-59-54.png) 13:24

For each one, you get an array with two items. The first item is always going to be the key, and the second value will always be the value. So if you wanted to split those up into their own vairables you could do the following: 

```
const key = entry[0];
const value = entry[1];
console.log(key,value);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-04-10-13-01-17.png) 13:51

Something that we have talked about that is very useful in this scenario is **destructuring**. Instead of using the square brackets and indexes on the entry array to grab each item, we can do this:

```js
const [key, value] = entry; 
```
What that code is doing is it is taking the first item in the entry array and assigning it to the variable key and it's taking the second item and assigning it to the variable value. 

That is the exact same thing as:
```
const key = entry[0];
const value = entry[1];
```

We could take it even one step further and destructure the entry variable inside of the function definition rather than in the function body. 


First we will modify this line of code: `Object.entries(meats).forEach(entry => {` and instead wrap `entry` in paranthesis like so: `Object.entries(meats).forEach((entry) => {`. If you refresh the page, everything should still work, we did nothing by adding those parenthesis. 

Now, instead of just passing one variable called `entry`, we are going to destructure that `entry` array into `key` and `value` directly.  Now within the function body we do not need to do any destructuring, we can just log the key and value variables directly. 

```
   Object.entries(meats).forEach(([key, value]) => {
        // const key = entry[0];
        // const value = entry[1];
        //const [key, value] = entry;
        console.log(key, value);
      });

```

`key` and `value` are not special names, you could name them anything you want, for example this would still work:


```
Object.entries(meats).forEach(([meat, qty]) => {
  // const key = entry[0];
  // const value = entry[1];
  //const [key, value] = entry;
  console.log(meat, qty);
});

```

There is nothing wrong with any of these approaches, they all work. Wes find that for some beginners destructuring can be a bit confusing so feel free to use the other approahces for now if they are more clear to you.
