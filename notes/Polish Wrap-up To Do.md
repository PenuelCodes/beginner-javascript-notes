# Polish Wrap-up To Do

To Do: 
- Language is specified for all code blocks
- Buzz words are bolded. Start collecting a list of all the words to compile into an index
- Spelling & Grammar check
- Rewording to be more concise
- Adding Subheadings / Formatting for clarity

Starting from the end and then going back. Unchecking the polish checklist sheets.
