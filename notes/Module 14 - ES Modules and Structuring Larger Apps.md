# Module 14 - ES Modules and Structuring Larger Apps


## 78 - Modules 

Let's talk about modules. 

Being able to share code across multiple javascript files and even across multiple projects is an easy thing to do when you start to use modules in Javascript.

So what are they? Modules are a way to structure and organize your Javascript, and it gives us the ability to share functionality and data across multiple files and projects. 

Here are a few things you need to know about modules:
- They have their own scope, similar to how a function has scope.
- They can hold anything (functionality, data, config)

If you recall in the previous lesson where we built a currency converter, we had a variable `currencies` that was a giant object of all the currency codes and names. 

It would be nice if instead of having that object directly in our file, we could put it in a separate module and then import it into the file to use when we need it. That is what modules will allow us to do. 

Another use case for modules is utility functions. In the Dad Jokes lesson that we finished, we had a `randomItemFromArray` method. That method is not specific to our Dad Jokes project, it's just a handy array utility. We could throw that off into a separate file that is used for utilities. 

Let's look at how modules work in the browser, and then we will look at some tooling that will help us work with them. 

You might hear modules referred to as **ESM**, **EcmaScript modules**, or **ES6 modules**. They were added to Javascript a couple of years ago, and they are the best way to organize your javavscript when you have multiple files. 

Let's go into our playground and create a folder called `modules` (it might already be there for you). 

Inside of that let's make the following files: `index.html`, `utils.j`, `handlers.js`, `scripts.js`. Now we have three different javascript files here. 

Let's say we had the following code in `scripts.js`: `const name = 'wes'`. 

In `utils.js`, lets add a simple function. 

```js
function returnHi(name){
  return `hi ${name}`;
}
```

So if we are in `scripts.js` and we want to use that `returnHi` function, can we?

Let's try. Modify the code like so. 

```
const name = 'wes';
console.log(returnHi(name)();
```

Now let's go into our `index.html` and add our base HTML if it is not already there. Let's add a script source tag and link it to `scripts.js`, and open it up in the browser.

When you do that, you should see an error that `returnHi` is not defined.  

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-06-59-50.png) 3:58

That makes sense becuase we have not yet put our `utils` on the page. You might think we can just add another script source tag above the one we added and link it to utils.

```
<script src="./utils.js"></script>
<script src="./scripts.js"></script>
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-05-17.png) 4:27

As you can see, now it works. All we had to do is put one script in front of the other one that we needed it in. This used to be the way we shared code across multiple files. 

That got out of hand pretty quickly because you had all these files that had dependencies and the order of the script tags affected the execution because they all have to load in a waterfall, which means one after the other. Each file is assuming that the other one has access to it. 

If you look at our `scripts.js` file in VS code, ESLint is complaining that `returnHi` is not defined. That is because that function does not exist within the file, so where did it come from? 

The only reason it works is because we have globally scoped the function in another file and we are just assuming that it will be available to us on the page. That is a very brittle way to write javacript. 

The solution to that is to use modules! When you need a function like `returnHi`, we can just import the function from the module, from the file that actually contains that function.

When you do that, you don't really have to worry about things loading before each other, because we will import the valuse we need before hand. 

Let's change this example to a very simple module. 

In our `index.html`, we will just have one script tag and that script tag is going to be your entry point into your Javascript. We will add the `type` attribuet on the script tag and set it to `module` like so:

```html
<scripts src="./scripts.js" type="module"></script>
```

Let's modify the code in our `scripts.js` file to contain the following:

```
const name = 'wes';
console.log('Its working...');
```

Let's refresh the HTML page and look at the console you will see a bunch of errors. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-15-19.png) 7:11


This first one is the CORS issue again. It is giving us trouble because you cannot use modules unless you are running it on a server. 

### Setting up Server 

We cannot use a Parcel server because Parcel also handles modules for us and Wes is trying to show us how they work without using a bundler. We just need a very simple server up and running. 

If you know how to run a server to serve us these files, feel free to skip ahead. (to 10:41)

There are a couple of different ways to do this. 

1. VSCode plugin

If you go to extensions in VS code and search for "Live Server", you should see an extension that matches it and you can click install. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-18-36.png) 8:13

If you go back to the modules and right click on the `index.html` and click open with Live server, and that will start it up in the browser. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-19-13.png) 8:26

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-19-33.png) 8:34

That will start up a localhost server. The url is `127.0.0.1:5550` which is the equivalent as localhost, it is just the IP address. You can replace it with localhost and it will work just the same `localhost:5550`. 

Now if you open up the dev tools, you will see that it is working. 

2. BrowserSync

Another way to get a server running. Open your terminal and run `npm install -g browser-sync`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-21-39.png) 9:16

Then we need to do into our `modules/playground` folder within the terminal and then we just type `browser-sync` and it should start up a server. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-22-53.png) 8:43

If you open up the dev tools, you will see it is working but we get an error regarding `base.css`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-07-23-08.png) 9:47

That is because we are running the server within our `/modules` folder but the base CSS file is actually at a higher level and it can't go up higher than the root. 

The solution for that is to open up `base.css`, copy all the content and then make a new file within our `/modules` directory called `base.css`. 

Now let's modify the path to that file within `index.html`. Modify it like so:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./base.css">
```

Now if you refresh the page, you should no longer see that error. 

It looks like both of those ways of making a server support live reload, so if you make a change to the HTML, css or javascript files, the browser will automatically reload the page. 

It actually looks like browsersync isn't doing hot-reloading, you may need to pass additional parameters. We will just stick with the VSCode server since it is the simplest one. 

Now that we have the server runnning, lets go back to where we left off. 

How do we take a function that exists in one file and use it in another? 
You can import it from that file. 

There are two types of imports:
1. **Named Imports**
2. **Default Imports**

Before we can import something, we first need to export it. Let's go to our `utils` file and export the `returnHi` function. 

```
function returnHi(name){
  return `hi ${name}`;
}
```

When sharing code between multiple files like this, the word we use for each file is a module (so a file is a module). 

If you want to surface functionality from one file to another, you first must export it. We will export it like this for now:

```
export function returnHi(name){
  return `hi ${name}`;
}
```

Now in our `scripts.js` we are going to import the name of the function that has been exported.

We do that by using the keyword `import`, then we have curly brackets inbetween which we supply the name of the function we want to import, whcih is `returnHi` in this case and then we add the keyword "from" and the relative path to the file that contains the export, which is `utils` in our case. 


```
import { returnHi } from "./utils.js";
```

Now within `scripts.js`, we should be able to add the following code:

```
import { returnHi } from "./utils.js";

const name = 'wes';
console.log(returnHi(name));
console.log('Its working....');
```

Now if you refresh the page, you will see that it is working.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-15-20-43.png) 12:30

To recap: 

What we did there is we defined some functionality in a separate file and in order for us to acccess that functionality, we must first export it from the file it is in. 

Exporting is basically saying "these things that I have exported can be used by other Javascript modules". 

Then in our `scripts.js` where we want to use that functionality, we simply import it from the file that it is in. 

Note: you always do your imports at the very top of the file that you are in, and you can have multiple imports as well. Then you simply have access to that functionality and can use it.  

### Things we need to know about Modules

#### Scope 

One thing that Wes mentioned briefly earlier is that modules have their own scope. 

What does that mean? Let's look at an example to demonstrate. 

Let's say we have the following variable within `utils.js`: `const last = 'bos';`. 

What would happen if we want to access that within the `scripts.js` file like so:

```
import { returnHi } from "./utils.js";

const name = 'wes';
console.log(returnHi(name));
console.log('Its working....');
console.log(last);
```

If you refresh the HTML page, you will see we get an error "last is not defined". That is because `last` is in a different module.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-16-49-29.png) 13:38

 What if within the `returnHi` function in `utils.js` we use the `last` variable like so 👇

```
export function returnHi(name){
  return `hi ${name} ${last}`;
}
```

Is that allowed? And is it going to work? 

Let's find out. Within our `scripts.js` let's remove `console.log(last)` that we just added a few steps ago and refresh the HTML page. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-17-06-30.png) 13:52

As you can see, it is working. 

That means that you can use variables that are defined inside of a module, and they will not leak out and become available in any other file, however you can use them inside of that module, no problem. 

That is what is referred to as scoped to the module. So the `last` variable is not available in the console if we were to try, because it is not globally scoped, and it is not available in my `scripts` module. 

The `last` variable is simply scoped to the `utils` file and can only be used within that file. 

Is that good practice? Yes! 

The beauty of modules is that you don't have to worry about scoping or anything like that. 
You can just create variables inside of that file and they are only available inside of that file and nowhere else.

Now what if we _did_ want to be able to access the `last` variable inside of the `scripts` file? We could export that variable by putting the `export` keyword infront of the variable declaration. 

```
export const last = 'bos';
```

Now within `scripts.js` we can modify our `import` statement to import that variable. 

```
import { returnHi, last } from './utils.js';
```

At the bottom of `scripts.js` let's log `console.log(last)`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-17-18-32.png) 15:07 

As you can see, that works!

Another way to export a value is instead of exporting it when you create it, you can export it from the bottom of the file like so `export { last }`. This is referred to as a named export because they have a name on them. 

Here is what the `utils.js` file looks like now:

```js
//utils.js
const last = 'bos';
export function returnHi(name){
  return `Hi ${name} ${last}`;
}
//NAMED exports
export { last }
```

Let's say we have multiple variables like `const middle = 'slam dunk'` and we wanted to export that as well we could either add an `export` to the variable declaration or we can export middle using a named export like so:

```js
//utils.js
const last = 'bos';
const middle = 'slam dunk';
export function returnHi(name){
  return `Hi ${name} ${last}`;
}
//NAMED exports
export { last, middle };
```

If you go into scripts and modify the file to import that variable and use it like so 👇

```js
//scripts.js
import { returnHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';

const name = 'wes';

console.log(returnHi(name));

console.log('Its working....');

console.log(last, middle);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-17-26-13.png) 16:18

Which type of export should you use? That is a personal preference so use what you prefer. 

Wes often uses a combination of both. 

You can also export async functions. If `returnHi` were async, we could export it like so: 

```
export async function returnHi(name){
  return `Hi ${name} ${last}`;
}
```

As mentioned earlier, that is what is referred to as **named exports** and **named imports**.

The way you can tell if something is a named export is if it has the `export` keyword infront of the function definition or variable declaration or it is exported using curly brackets. Curly brackets means it is a named export. 

The other way to do that is a called a **default export**. 

Every module can have as many **named exports** as they want. 
However, a module can only have one **default export**, which is the default this the file exports. 

If we make another module `wes.json` and in it we will assign a variable `person` to an object, and then export that variable like so:

```
const person = {
  name: 'Wes',
  last: 'Bos'
}

export default person;
```

Then if you want to access the `person` object within `scripts.js`, we could import it like so: 

```
import { returnHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
import wes from './wes.js';
```

Now let's log it `console.log(wes)`.  

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-19-15-20.png) 17:58

Now we could have named that import anything we wanted. 

For example we could have done 

```
import { returnHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
import westernhoff from './wes.js';

console.log(westerhoff);
```

If you refresh the page, you will see it still works. 

The difference between default exports and named exports is that with named imports, you must know what the name they have been exported as, but since there is only one default export per file, you can import them and name they whatever you want. 

Which type of export should you use? There are certainly arguments on both sides. 

Wes will usually use a default export if the module does one thing, but if the module does multiple things, like a utility library or something like that, then you can just have multiple named exports from it.

You can have both named and default exports in one file. 

In `utils.js`, we will default export a variable called `first`, by adding the following code to the botto of the file 👇

```
const first = 'wes';
export default first; 
```

Now within `scripts.js`, if we wanted to import that it wouldn't go in curly brackets because that is only for named and `first` is the default. So we could import and log it like so: 

```
import first, { returnHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
import westernhoff from './wes.js';

console.log(westerhoff);
console.log(first);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-19-28-13.png) 19:58 

To reiterate: named are in curly brackets, default are always only one and always outside of the curly brackets.

Another thing about modules is you can rename them as you import them. 

Let's say we wanted to rename `returnHi` to `sayHi`. We could do that right in the import statement. 

```
import first, { returnHi as sayHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
```

That will import `returnHi` and rename it to `sayHi`, kind of like destructuring but with different syntax because we use the `as` keyword. 

Now let's replace where we are calling `returnHi` and instead call `sayHi`. Let's also log `sayHi`. 


```
import first, { returnHi as sayHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
import westernhoff from './wes.js';

console.log(westerhoff);
console.log(sayHi);
console.log(first);

const name = 'ws'; 

console.log(returnHi(name));

console.log('Its working...');

console.log(last, middle);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-19-38-57.png) 20:39

As you can see, when we log `sayHi`, you see that we have that function there as `returnHi`. 

Let's take a quick look at the docs. Google "mdn import". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-19-40-30.png) 20:51

As you can see those are all the different types of imports. 

Sometimes you will see people importing modules by leaving the `.js` off. Let's try that. 

Remove the `.js` from the `utils` import statement like so: 

```
import first, { returnHi as sayHi, last, middle } from './utils';
```

When you refresh the page, you will see we get an error. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-19-41-58.png) 21:06

In a lot of bundlers, like Parcel,  you can leave the end `.js` off, but that isn't part of the specs, so if you are using pure HTML-browser based loading (like we are) you must include it. 

```
import defaultExport from "module-name";
import * as name from "module-name";
import { export1 } from "module-name";
import { export1 as alias1 } from "module-name";
import { export1 , export2 } from "module-name";
import { foo , bar } from "module-name/path/to/specific/un-exported/file";
import { export1 , export2 as alias2 , [...] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, { export1 [ , [...] ] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, * as name from "module-name";
import "module-name";
var promise = import("module-name");
```


Let's keep going through the different ways to import.

`import * as name from 'module-name';`
You can import everything that comes in as name. 

Let's go into `wes.js` and let's add the following code:

```
const person = {
   name: 'Wes',
   last: 'Bos',
}

export default person;

export const dog = 'Snickers';
export const food = 'pizza';
export function eat(){
  console.log('chomp chomp');
}
```

By the way -- you import modules into any other modules, it's not limited to the entry point (which is `scripts.js` in our example). 

`dog`, `food` and `eat` are named exports, and if we wanted to import them into `scripts`, we could do the following:

```
import first, { returnHi as sayHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
//import westernhoff from './wes.js';
import * as everything from './wes.js';

//console.log(westerhoff);
console.log(everything);
console.log(sayHi);
console.log(first);

const name = 'ws'; 

console.log(returnHi(name));

console.log('Its working...');

console.log(last, middle);
```

What we did is we commented our existing import of the `wes.js` module and replaced it with `import * as everything from './wes.js';`, and then in the file we log `everything`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-20-05-09.png) 23:05

If you look at the console you will see that we get this thing that kinda looks like an object but its called a module.

Inside of it we have our `default`, `dog`, `eat` and `food`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-20-10-27.png) 23:25

That is useful when you want to import absolutely everything from a module.

You can `import { export1 as alias } from 'module-name';`. 

Wes will refer to these docs often but 99% of the time he will just use the `returnHi as sayHi` and that will cover you almost all of the time.

They also have docs for export where you can see how to export different types of expressions and objects and things like that (we will be covering some in the examples we do). 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-27-20-13-19.png) 24:16

The last thing we want to do is called an `on-demand` import. 

```
var promise = import("module-name");
```

That is handy when you want to import things nly when you need them. 

Lets say we go into the `/exercises/77 - Currency` folder and grab the big `currencies` object and copy it. 

Let's go back to our `modules` folder and create a new file called `currencies.js` and paste that object within the file. 

If we try to export it as default by putting `export default` infront of the declaration, that will not work.
```
export default const currencies = {..
```

If we want to export default a variable declaration, we must go to the bottom of the file and export it like so 👇

```
export const currencies = {
  USD: 'United States Dollar',
  AUD: 'Australian Dollar',
  BGN: 'Bulgarian Lev',
  BRL: 'Brazilian Real',
  CAD: 'Canadian Dollar',
  CHF: 'Swiss Franc',
  CNY: 'Chinese Yuan',
  CZK: 'Czech Republic Koruna',
  DKK: 'Danish Krone',
  GBP: 'British Pound Sterling',
  HKD: 'Hong Kong Dollar',
  HRK: 'Croatian Kuna',
  HUF: 'Hungarian Forint',
  IDR: 'Indonesian Rupiah',
  ILS: 'Israeli New Sheqel',
  INR: 'Indian Rupee',
  JPY: 'Japanese Yen',
  KRW: 'South Korean Won',
  MXN: 'Mexican Peso',
  MYR: 'Malaysian Ringgit',
  NOK: 'Norwegian Krone',
  NZD: 'New Zealand Dollar',
  PHP: 'Philippine Peso',
  PLN: 'Polish Zloty',
  RON: 'Romanian Leu',
  RUB: 'Russian Ruble',
  SEK: 'Swedish Krona',
  SGD: 'Singapore Dollar',
  THB: 'Thai Baht',
  TRY: 'Turkish Lira',
  ZAR: 'South African Rand',
  EUR: 'Euro',
};

export default currencies;
```

Let's say we want to click a button and get all of the currencies. One problem we might have is that it's too big of a file to load on homepage or when your scripts load. It also might not be necessary to actually load the currencies.

A popular thing to do is people will on-demand load Javascript, for example a shopping cart Javascript will only be loaded when someone hovers over a buy now button. Or a list of counties might only be loaded when someone opens the checkout. 

Loading javascript on demand ensures that your website loads nice and fast because we are not loading Javascript until we need it. 

If we want to add a button to our page that when you click it, it will load the currencies, it would work like this. 

Let's go to the html and add a button right in the body tag like so 

```
<body>
  <button>Load Currencies</button>
  <script src="./scripts.js" type="module"></scripts>
```

Now in our `scripts.js`, lets remove everything but this code to start. 

```
import first, { returnHi as sayHi, last, middle } from './utils.js';
import * as everything from './wes.js';
```

Let's start by selecting the button and listening for a click on it. 
We are going to do something different this time by putting the code we will pass to our event listener in another file. 

Normally we would just go above the event listener and make a function like `handleButtonClick` or something that we would pass to it. 

Instead, we will go into our `handlers.js` file and make a function called `handleButtonClick` which for now will just log the event, and we will export that. 

```
export function handleButtonClick(event){
  console.log(event);
}
```

Back in `scripts.js` we need to import it now. 

```
import { handleButtonClick } from './handlers.js';

const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick);
```

This is normally what Wes does, have a JS file that will select his elements and hook up the event listeners, and then almost all his other utilities, data, functionality and handlers all go in separate files. 

That allows Wes to import them as he needs them and that keeps `scripts.js` which is the entry point nice and lean. He can open the file and quickly get an idea of the functionality. 

Then if he wants to know how something works, he needs to dig a bit further into the modules and read that.

If you refresh the HTML page and try clicking on the button, you will see the event logged. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-29-55.png) 28:47

Now we can go to `handlers.js` and work on that function. 

When the button is clicked, we want to get all the currencies. We could simply import them like so `import currencies from './currencies.js'`.  Now within the function, let's log `currencies`. 

If you do that, and refresh the page while the network tab is open, you will see all of the script modules that are being loaded.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-31-53.png) 29:39

If you comment out that import statement and refresh the HTML page, you will see currencies is no longer in the network tab.

How do we on-demand load some data or some functionality from a module? We can make it `async`. 

```
export async function handleButtonClick(event){
  const currencies = await import('./currencies.js');
  console.log(currencies);
}
```

Now when you refresh the HTML page, you will see that currencies is no longer in the network tab until we click the button and then it is loaded.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-33-44.png) 30:15

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-33-59.png) 30:17

That request was only made after we clicked the button.

Now we have the module logged in the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-34-39.png) 30:30

Now if we want to access the currencies we need to get the default. Let's refactor the import slightly to rename the variable. 

```
export async function handleButtonClick(event){
  const currenciesModule = await import('./currencies.js');
  console.log(currenciesModule.default);
}
```

Now when you refresh the page, you should have access to the curencies and they should be logged in the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-35-54.png) 30:53 

It does cache it, so if someone were to click the button again, the currencies would be loaded instantly instead of needing to be fetched again. 

Let's say `currencies.js` had another export, such as `export const localCurrency = 'CAD'`.  How would we also import that on demand?

If you refresh the HTML page, you will see that we do have the `localCurrency` in the `module`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-39-12.png) 31:37

Let's destructure them into their own variables with curly brakcets like so:

```
const { localCurrency, default } = await import('./currencies.js');
console.log(localCurrency, default);
```

However if you try to do that, you will see the editor yelling at us that `default` is a reserved keyword, which means you cannot use it as a variable name.

So what we have to do is rename it. 

```
const { localCurrency, default: curency } = await import('./currencies.js');
console.log(localCurrency, currency);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-06-41-47.png) 32:21

So when we are destructuring a property like `default` that is not allowed to be named `default`, we can use destructuring renaming like so `default: currency`.

## 79 -  Currency Module Refactor

In this lesson let's take the currency conversion example we did and convert it into modules. 

Feel free to try this one yourself. 

Go into our `/exercises` folder and find the folder containing the currency converter we built. 

Duplicate that folder within the `/exercises` root and rename it to `79 - Currency Module Refactor`. Within that folder let's get rid of the `money-FINISHED.js` file.

Let's start by opening up the `index.html` and adding a `type="module"` on our existing script source tag.

Now `money.js` is our entry point. 

Let's take a look at what we are working with. 

```
const fromSelect = document.querySelector('[name="from_currency"]');
const fromInput = document.querySelector('[name="from_amount"]');
const toSelect = document.querySelector('[name="to_currency"]');
const toEl = document.querySelector('.to_amount');
const form = document.querySelector('.app form');
const endpoint = 'https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest';
const ratesByBase = {};

const currencies = {
  USD: 'United States Dollar',
  AUD: 'Australian Dollar',
  BGN: 'Bulgarian Lev',
  BRL: 'Brazilian Real',
  CAD: 'Canadian Dollar',
  CHF: 'Swiss Franc',
  CNY: 'Chinese Yuan',
  CZK: 'Czech Republic Koruna',
  DKK: 'Danish Krone',
  GBP: 'British Pound Sterling',
  HKD: 'Hong Kong Dollar',
  HRK: 'Croatian Kuna',
  HUF: 'Hungarian Forint',
  IDR: 'Indonesian Rupiah',
  ILS: 'Israeli New Sheqel',
  INR: 'Indian Rupee',
  JPY: 'Japanese Yen',
  KRW: 'South Korean Won',
  MXN: 'Mexican Peso',
  MYR: 'Malaysian Ringgit',
  NOK: 'Norwegian Krone',
  NZD: 'New Zealand Dollar',
  PHP: 'Philippine Peso',
  PLN: 'Polish Zloty',
  RON: 'Romanian Leu',
  RUB: 'Russian Ruble',
  SEK: 'Swedish Krona',
  SGD: 'Singapore Dollar',
  THB: 'Thai Baht',
  TRY: 'Turkish Lira',
  ZAR: 'South African Rand',
  EUR: 'Euro',
};

function generateOptions(options) {
  return Object.entries(options)
    .map(
      ([currencyCode, currencyName]) =>
        `<option value="${currencyCode}">${currencyCode} - ${currencyName}</option>`
    )
    .join('');
}

async function fetchRates(base = 'USD') {
  const res = await fetch(`${endpoint}?base=${base}`);
  const rates = await res.json();
  return rates;
}

async function convert(amount, from, to) {
  // first check if we even have the rates to convert from that currency
  if (!ratesByBase[from]) {
    console.log(
      `Oh no, we dont have ${from} to convert to ${to}. So gets go get it!`
    );
    const rates = await fetchRates(from);
    console.log(rates);
    // store them for next time
    ratesByBase[from] = rates;
  }
  // convert that amount that they passed it
  const rate = ratesByBase[from].rates[to];
  const convertedAmount = rate * amount;
  console.log(`${amount} ${from} is ${convertedAmount} in ${to}`);
  return convertedAmount;
}

function formatCurrency(amount, currency) {
  return Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency,
  }).format(amount);
}
async function handleInput(e) {
  const rawAmount = await convert(
    fromInput.value,
    fromSelect.value,
    toSelect.value
  );
  toEl.textContent = formatCurrency(rawAmount, toSelect.value);
}

const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
// populate the options elements
fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

form.addEventListener('input', handleInput);
```

We are selecting a bunch of elements, we have a `ratesByBase` and `currencies` object. 

Then we have a few functions like `generateOptions`, `fetchRates`  which needs the endpoint, we have a convert, format currency and one handler.

So we have some library functions (library functions are functions considered core to our application), some handlers, and then `generateOptions` which is a helper or utility method, and then we have some data. 

We won't use any folders for this example, Wes will show us how to do that with a flat file strucutre. 

So within our `79 - Currency Refactor` folder create a file called `currencies.js`. 

Let's take our entire `currencies` object and paste it in there. It is a big enough object that Wes would give it it's own file. 

```
//currencies.js

const currencies = {
  USD: 'United States Dollar',
  AUD: 'Australian Dollar',
  BGN: 'Bulgarian Lev',
  BRL: 'Brazilian Real',
  CAD: 'Canadian Dollar',
  CHF: 'Swiss Franc',
  CNY: 'Chinese Yuan',
  CZK: 'Czech Republic Koruna',
  DKK: 'Danish Krone',
  GBP: 'British Pound Sterling',
  HKD: 'Hong Kong Dollar',
  HRK: 'Croatian Kuna',
  HUF: 'Hungarian Forint',
  IDR: 'Indonesian Rupiah',
  ILS: 'Israeli New Sheqel',
  INR: 'Indian Rupee',
  JPY: 'Japanese Yen',
  KRW: 'South Korean Won',
  MXN: 'Mexican Peso',
  MYR: 'Malaysian Ringgit',
  NOK: 'Norwegian Krone',
  NZD: 'New Zealand Dollar',
  PHP: 'Philippine Peso',
  PLN: 'Polish Zloty',
  RON: 'Romanian Leu',
  RUB: 'Russian Ruble',
  SEK: 'Swedish Krona',
  SGD: 'Singapore Dollar',
  THB: 'Thai Baht',
  TRY: 'Turkish Lira',
  ZAR: 'South African Rand',
  EUR: 'Euro',
};

export default currencies;
```

Let's make a new file called `utils.js` and inside of that we will paste our `generateOptions` method and we will make it a named export. 

```
//utils.js
export function generateOptions(options) {
  return Object.entries(options)
    .map(
      ([currencyCode, currencyName]) =>
        `<option value="${currencyCode}">${currencyCode} - ${currencyName}</option>`
    )
    .join('');
}
```

Next we will make another file called `lib.js`. Let's move the `fetchRates` and `convert` functions to that file. 

```js
//lib.js
export async function fetchRates(base = 'USD') {
  const res = await fetch(`${endpoint}?base=${base}`);
  const rates = await res.json();
  return rates;
}

export async function convert(amount, from, to) {
  // first check if we even have the rates to convert from that currency
  if (!ratesByBase[from]) {
    console.log(
      `Oh no, we dont have ${from} to convert to ${to}. So gets go get it!`
    );
    const rates = await fetchRates(from);
    console.log(rates);
    // store them for next time
    ratesByBase[from] = rates;
  }
  // convert that amount that they passed it
  const rate = ratesByBase[from].rates[to];
  const convertedAmount = rate * amount;
  console.log(`${amount} ${from} is ${convertedAmount} in ${to}`);
  return convertedAmount;
}
```

Let's take the next function `formatCurrency` and put it in the `utils.js` file like so:

```
//utils.js
export function generateOptions(options) {
  return Object.entries(options)
    .map(
      ([currencyCode, currencyName]) =>
        `<option value="${currencyCode}">${currencyCode} - ${currencyName}</option>`
    )
    .join('');
}
export function formatCurrency(amount, currency) {
  return Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency,
  }).format(amount);
}
```

We have `handleInput` which is a handler so let's make a new file `handlers.js` and add that there. 

```
export sync function handleInput(e) {
  const rawAmount = await convert(
    fromInput.value,
    fromSelect.value,
    toSelect.value
  );
  toEl.textContent = formatCurrency(rawAmount, toSelect.value);
}
```

Now we are left with the following code in `money.js`.

```
//money.js
const fromSelect = document.querySelector('[name="from_currency"]');
const fromInput = document.querySelector('[name="from_amount"]');
const toSelect = document.querySelector('[name="to_currency"]');
const toEl = document.querySelector(".to_amount");
const form = document.querySelector(".app form");
const endpoint = "https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest";
const ratesByBase = {};

const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
// populate the options elements
fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

form.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
```

We have our options generation which we do on page load, our initialization and then our listeners. 

Let's start going one by one and decide if we are going to move the rest of the code from `money.js` or not.

Let's open up `index.html` in a VSCode live server and look to see if we have any errors in the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-09-54.png) 4:07

It is complaining that `generateOptions` is not defined. Let's import it.

```
import { generateOptions } from './utils.js';
```

Now we get an error saying `currencies` is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-11-02.png) 4:25

Let's import currencies so we can pass it to `generateOptions`. 

```
import { generateOptions } from './utils.js';
import { currencies } from './currencies.js'
```

If you refresh the page you will see we have yet another error. This time it is complaining that it cannot find an export named `currencies`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-12-26.png) 4:43

That is because it is a default export, not a named export, so it doesn't need the curly brackets. 

Modify it like so: `import currencies from './currencies.js';`

Now when we look at the console you will see it is complaining that `handleInput` is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-17-12.png) 4:59

Let's fix that by adding `import { handleInput } from './handlers';`

Now there are no more errors in the console but when we try to type in an amount, we see a reference error in the console complaining that `convert` is not defined, and it is happening in `handlers.js` on line 2.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-18-27.png) 5:25

Let's fix that by importing the `convert` function into `handlers`. 

```
import { convert } from "./lib.js";
export sync function handleInput(e) {
  const rawAmount = await convert(
    fromInput.value,
    fromSelect.value,
    toSelect.value
  );
  toEl.textContent = formatCurrency(rawAmount, toSelect.value);
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-26-55.png) 5:55

Now we get another error that `fromInput` is not defined. Within `handleInput` we use the `fromInput`, `fromSelect`, `toSelect` and `toEl` variables. 

We also reference the function `formatCurrency` which we haven't imported. Let's import it to `handlers.js` like so `import { formatCurrency } from "./utils";`

We need all those elements now, and rather than pass them in as an argument to the function, let's put them in their own module. 

Create a new file called `elements.js`. 

Go into `money.js` and take all our selectors and move them to our new `elements.js` file. Let's add the export keyword infront of each.

```
//elements.js
export const fromSelect = document.querySelector('[name="from_currency"]');
export const fromInput = document.querySelector('[name="from_amount"]');
export const toSelect = document.querySelector('[name="to_currency"]');
export const toEl = document.querySelector(".to_amount");
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-08-35-21.png) 6:53 

What people will often do is instead of using `document.querySelector` for all of those, they will grab a parent element like the div with a class of `app` in the example above, and then look for the selectors inside of there. 

You would have `app.querySelector` for each of those instead which allows you to have multiple on the same page, just like we did with the slider.

The way we are doing it is fine for now. 

If you refresh the page, we have an error `fromSelect` is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-14-52-06.png) 7:11

Let's first go into `handlers` and import those elements. 

```
import { convert } from "./lib.js";
import { formatCurrency } from "./utils.js";
import { fromInput, fromSelect, toSelect, toEl } from "./elements.js";

export async function handleInput(e) {
  const rawAmount = await convert(
    fromInput.value,
    fromSelect.value,
    toSelect.value
  );
  toEl.textContent = formatCurrency(rawAmount, toSelect.value);
}
```

Now lets tackle the `fromSelect` is not defined bug in `money.js` line 11.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-14-55-41.png) 7:44

As you can see, `fromSelect` and `toSelect` are also needed from `money.js` on page load. Let's go ahead and import them. 

```js
//money.js
import { generateOptions } from "./utils.js";
import currencies from "./currencies.js";
import { handleInput } from "./handlers.js";
import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js"

const form = document.querySelector(".app form");
const endpoint = "https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest";
const ratesByBase = {};

const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
// populate the options elements
fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

form.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
```

Now when we refresh, we are getting an error that ratesByBase is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-17-12-41.png) 8:07

Our `endpoint` and `ratesByBase` variables need to go in our `lib.js` file. 

Let's copy those over to the lib.js file. 

```
//lib.js
const endpoint = "https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest";
const ratesByBase = {};

export async function fetchRates(base = "USD") {
  const res = await fetch(`${endpoint}?base=${base}`);
  const rates = await res.json();
  return rates;
}

export async function convert(amount, from, to) {
  // first check if we even have the rates to convert from that currency
  if (!ratesByBase[from]) {
    console.log(
      `Oh no, we dont have ${from} to convert to ${to}. So gets go get it!`
    );
    const rates = await fetchRates(from);
    console.log(rates);
    // store them for next time
    ratesByBase[from] = rates;
  }
  // convert that amount that they passed it
  const rate = ratesByBase[from].rates[to];
  const convertedAmount = rate * amount;
  console.log(`${amount} ${from} is ${convertedAmount} in ${to}`);
  return convertedAmount;
}
```

Now if you refresh the page, you will see that it is now working! Feel free to play around with the app to test it. 

That was simpler than Wes expected -- he thought dealing with the `ratesByBase` variable would be tricky because we are updating it. 

However, the beauty of module scope is that inside of the module, we can create the `ratesByBase` object and update it from our `convert` function. Even though we are calling the `convert` from another file, it still knows about the scope of the file (similar to how a closure works), so we can still access it without issues. 

The only gotcha about these modules is that if you are on a server, the `ratesByBase` will be shared by every request that comes in which may or may not be what you want. 

Wes has ran into an issue where Wes was storing data in one module that was being overwritten by multiple users. If that is the case, you need to get into sessions or scope it to each funciton but in our case, and most cases ,this is fine. 

We have refactored the entire app into modules, which makes it a bit more organized to work with and more modular. 

One more thing Wes wants to show us is a situation where we might take the form element and put it into a bootstrap or app init function. What does that mean?

All of this code in `money.js` runs on page load. 

```
//when the page loads, this code runs
const form = document.querySelector(".app form");

const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
// populate the options elements
fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

form.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
```

Sometimes you might want to delay the running of what happens on page load. If that is the case, what we would do is take all that logic from `money.js` and go to `lib.js` and make another function. 


```
//lib.js
export function init() {
  // when the page loads, this code runs
  const form = document.querySelector(".app form");

  const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
  // populate the options elements
  fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
  toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

  form.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
}
```

We also need to import `fromSelect` and `toSelect`. Add the import below the other imports at the top of `libs.js` 

```
import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js";
```

Now if you try to play with the app, nothing will happen because nothing has started. 

If we go back to `money.js`, we can now import that `init` function and start the app. 

```
import { generateOptions } from "./utils.js";
import currencies from "./currencies.js";
import { handleInput } from "./handlers.js";
import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js";
import { init } from "./lib.js";

init();
```

If you refresh the page now, you will see the following error complaining that `generateOptions` is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-17-25-25.png) 11:42

We need to go to `lib.js` and import `generateOptions`. 

```
import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js";
import { generateOptions } from "./utils.js";
```

Now if we refresh it is complaining about `currencies` not being defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-17-27-17.png) 12:17

What we can do is go to `money.js` and take all our import statements except for the `init` import and move them to `lib.js`. 

```
import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js";
import { generateOptions } from "./utils.js";
import currencies from "./currencies.js";
import { handleInput } from "./handlers.js";
```

Wes' ESLint is complaining about the `handleInput` import. The error says "Dependency cycle detected". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-17-29-33.png) 12:39

If you look at our `handlers.js`, we are importing `convert` from there from `lib`. So both files require each other. That could cause you to end up with a situation where they require each other and it gets out of control. For our purposes, it is working, but let's fix that anyway.

Let's create one more file called `init.js` 

Let's take our `init` function and all the imports we added out of `lib.js` and put it in our `init.js` file instead. 

```
//init.js

import { fromSelect, toSelect } from "./elements.js";
import { generateOptions } from "./utils.js";
import currencies from "./currencies.js";
import { handleInput } from "./handlers.js";

export function init() {
  // when the page loads, this code runs
  const form = document.querySelector(".app form");

  const optionsHTML = generateOptions(currencies);
  // populate the options elements
  fromSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;
  toSelect.innerHTML = optionsHTML;

  form.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
}

```

Now in `money.js` let's modify the code to import from `init.js` instead. 

```
//money.js
import { init } from "./init.js";

init();

```

Now if you refresh the page and play with the app, you will see that it is working! 

We could go one step further and not even run the code unless someone clicks a button or hovers over it. 

To do that let's select the div with class of app within `money.js`. 

We will pass the event listener out `init` function to call, and also pass the options object to the event listener to specify we only want it to run once. 

```
import { init } from "./init.js";

const app = document.querySelector(".app");

app.addEventListener("mouseenter", init, { once: true });
```

Now when the page loads, it just says "Select a Currency" until you hover over the form, and then the code initializes and the base currency is switched out to USD.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-28-17-35-43.png) 14:26

Now our entry point has almost nothing in it because it is in a separate file. 

Is that okay? Yes, some people like their entry point to have a little code but you could have also left all the code in `money.js` as well and it still would have worked!

## 80 - Dad Jokes Modules Refactor

In this lesson we will refactor our dad jokes exercise so you can see how Wes would structure that. 

Let's start by duplicating the `76 - Dad Jokes` folder within the `exercises/` directory and renaming it to `80 - Dad Jokes Modules`. 

Let's start by taking all the code in `jokes-FINISHED.js` and putting it `jokes.js` and the deleting the finished version of the file.

NOw let's convert this to modules by first putting an attribute of `type="module"` on the script tag on our HTML page. 

The second thing we need to do is run it under a server which we can do in VSCode by right clicking the file in VSCode and selecting "open with live server". 

When the server loads, the dad jokes app should be working as expected.

Let's take a look at the code within `jokes.js` and start splitting it out line by line, function by function. 

```js
//jokes.js
const jokeButton = document.querySelector('.getJoke');
const jokeButtonSpan = jokeButton.querySelector('.jokeText');
const jokeHolder = document.querySelector('.joke p');
const loader = document.querySelector('.loader');

const buttonText = [
  'Ugh.',
  '🤦🏻‍♂️',
  'omg dad.',
  'you are the worst',
  'seriously',
  'stop it.',
  'please stop',
  'that was the worst one',
];

async function fetchJoke() {
  // turn loader on
  loader.classList.remove('hidden');
  const response = await fetch('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
    },
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // turn the loader off
  loader.classList.add('hidden');
  return data;
}

function randomItemFromArray(arr, not) {
  const item = arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
  if (item === not) {
    console.log('Ahh we used that one last time, look again');
    return randomItemFromArray(arr, not);
  }
  return item;
}

async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}

jokeButton.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

```

Our entry point will be `jokes.js` because that is what we have linked on the HTML page.

In the entry point, Wes like to do his selecting and event listeners but everything else, all of the data, functionality, utilities and handlers will all be in separate files in their own modules. 

Let's keep the first 4 lines of code where we are selecting elements where it is. 

Where should we put the `buttonText` variable? Let's put it in it's own file. Sometimes people will organize their code into folders, so to demonstrate that, we will put this in a folder called `data`, which you need to create. 

Within the folder let's add a file called `buttonText.js`. 

Copy and paste the buttonText variable in that file. We will worry about importing and exporting these functions between modules later, for now we just want to get all of the different functions into their own files. 

Next is the `fetchJoke` function. That is core to what the application does so often people will make a `lib` folder for this. Let's make that folder.  
(Note: you don't have to do this, Wes personally finds it confusing when people have hundreds of folders for organization sakes. Feel free to just make files in the root directory or organize your files however you like. Wes suggests starting simple and the coming back and refactoring if you need more organization.)

Within that `lib` directory we will create a file `index.js` which will contain all of our library javascript.

Copy and cut the `fetchJoke` function into the `index.js` file.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-07-03-18.png) 3:31

In Wes' VSCode, the loader variable within `fetchJokes` is underlined as red because that function needs to access the loader but we have not passed it a reference to the loader. 

Because modules have their own scope, we are no longer able to reference the `loader` variable from the `jokes.js` module.

There are two ways we can fix this. We can either select the loader within that function, or we can pass it in as a parameter. We will pass it as a parameter. 

Let's also export the function as a named function.

```
//lib/index.js
//named export, you can have lots of these
export async function fetchJoke(loader) {
  // turn loader on
  loader.classList.remove('hidden');
  const response = await fetch('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
    },
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // turn the loader off
  loader.classList.add('hidden');
  return data;
}
```

Now we have to modify the function that calls `fetchJoke` so it can pass the loader. 

```js
//money.js
async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke(loader);
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}
```
 
Let's go back to our buttonText and do a default export. 

```
//data/buttonText.js
const buttonText = [
  "Ugh.",
  "🤦🏻‍♂️",
  "omg dad.",
  "you are the worst",
  "seriously",
  "stop it.",
  "please stop",
  "that was the worst one",
];

//default export, you can only have one. 
export default buttonText;
```

Why did we put the `buttonText` in it's own file? Because Wes thinks that is all the file is going to do, so that is the main export.

The `index.js` and `lib` folders may contain multiple functions, like you would have when building a larger app, and typically this is how Wes would organize them.

The next function is `randomItemFromArray`. That is a utility function so let's make a file called `utils.j` inside of the `lib` directory. People will often make an entire folder dedicated to utils, it doesn't matter, go with what you prefer. 

Wes likes to make a `utils.js` file and stick anything in there and then if it gets too large, we will break it up into separate functions. 

```
//lib/utils.js
//named export
export function randomItemFromArray(arr, not) {
  const item = arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
  if (item === not) {
    console.log('Ahh we used that one last time, look again');
    return randomItemFromArray(arr, not);
  }
  return item;
}

```

Next up we have `handleClick`. Let's make another file in `lib` called `handlers.js`. Take the `handleClick` function out of `jokes.js` and put it there. 

```
//lib/handlers.js
//named export
async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}
```

At this stage of the refactor, the code will be pretty broken, so Wes approaches it either by going through the errors in the console, or by ESLint errors. Let's do it in the console. 

The first error we are seeing is that `handleClick` is not defined. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-07-16-29.png)

That is because we moved `handleClick` into our `handlers.js` module. If we need to access `handleClick` we need to import it. 

```
//jokes.js
import { handleClick } from "./lib/handlers.js";

const jokeButton = document.querySelector(".getJoke");
const jokeButtonSpan = jokeButton.querySelector(".jokeText");
const jokeHolder = document.querySelector(".joke p");
const loader = document.querySelector(".loader");

jokeButton.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

Now there seems to be no errors but when you click the button, we might get one. Let's try it. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-08-35-09.png) 7:19

We get another error logged in the console, this time `handlers.js` is complaining that `fetchJoke` is not defined.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-08-36-19.png) 7:27

As you can see, we need the `fetchJoke` function within `handleClick`. So do we import `fetchJoke` in our `jokes.js` entry point or into our `handlers.js` module? The answer is you always import it where you need it, even if you have already imported it into another file.

So even if we imported `fetchJoke` in `jokes.js`  and tried to refresh the page and click the button, we would see get the error `fetchJoke` is not defined. 

Why is that? 
Even though we imported it into our entry, we still have to import it where we need it. 

There is no point of importing it into our entry file right now because we are not using it anywhere in the page. There is no sense in importing things into a file where they are not used.

You simply import it where you need it. So let's go ahead and do that in `handlers.js`. 

```
//lib/handlers.js
import { fetchJoke } from './index.js';
//named export
async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-08-41-20.png) 8:54

Now we get an error that loader is not defined within `handlers.js`. 

We modified the `fetchJoke` function to accept a reference to the loader, but now we are calling it from a separate file, so how do we pass it?

Our `handleClick` now has to take an argument so we could do this...

```
//jokes.js
import { handleClick } from "./lib/handlers.js";

const jokeButton = document.querySelector(".getJoke");
const jokeButtonSpan = jokeButton.querySelector(".jokeText");
const jokeHolder = document.querySelector(".joke p");
const loader = document.querySelector(".loader");

jokeButton.addEventListener("click", () => handleClick(loader));

```


![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-08-43-35.png) 9:32

It is still complaiing that it still not defined. That is because we have to modify our `handleClick` function to accept the `loader` reference as a parameter. 

```
//lib/handlers.js
import { fetchJoke } from './index.js';
//named export
async function handleClick(loader) {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-08-44-39.png) 9:43 

Now the loader shows up. 

Another way we could have done that is by adding `jokeButton.addEventListener('click', handleClick.bind(null, loader))` to `jokes.js`. We are passing null to `bind` because we don't care about `this`, we aren't using `this` so we don't care, and then we pass it the argument which is loader. 

We also could have done it as a regular function that will call 
handleClick. Let's use an anonymous function. 

```
jokeButton.addEventListner('click', function(){
  handleClick(loader);
});
```

Sometimes you have to pass around things like we are with the loader. We selected it in `jokes.js`, passed it to `handleClick`, and then from `handleClick` we passed it to `fetchJoke`. 

We could have also selected it right inside of `handleClick` as well, it is up to you.
 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-19-45-28.png) 10:46

Now that the loader is showing up, let's move onto the error in the console complaining that `jokeHolder` is not defiend within `handlers.js`. 

We have a bit of a problem because handleClick needs the loader, the `jokeButtonSpan` and the `jokeHolder`. So do we modify `handleClick` to take two more arguments? 

Instead of doing that, let's solve the issue by creating another module that will do all of our selecting. 

Let's go into our `lib` folder and create a file called `elements.js`. 

Copy all our `querySelectors` from `jokes.js` and paste them into `elements.js`. Add an export infront of each. 


```
// elements.js

export const jokeButton = document.querySelector(".getJoke");
export const jokeButtonSpan = jokeButton.querySelector(".jokeText");
export const jokeHolder = document.querySelector(".joke p");
export const loader = document.querySelector(".loader");
```

Now we no longer have to pass the loader to lets modify the call to `handleClick` in `jokes.js`. 

Let's also import the `jokeButton`. 

```
//jokes.js
import { handleClick } from "./lib/handlers.js";
import { jokeButton } from "./lib/elements.js";

jokeButton.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

Now let's go to our handler and fix that file. 

WE no longer have to pass the loader to `handleClick` so let's remove that param.

Let's take the `loader`, `jokeHolder`, `jokeButtonSpan` and import them. 


```
//handlers.js
import { loader, jokeHolder, jokeButtonSpan } from "elements.js";
import { fetchJoke } from "./index.js";

export async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}

```

Now when you press the button, it will fetch a joke and display it but we get an error in the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-19-54-53.png) 12:31

It is complaining that `randomItemFromArray` is not defined in `handlers.js` so let's import that from our `utils.js`. 

```
// handlers.js
import { loader, jokeHolder, jokeButtonSpan } from "elements.js";
import { fetchJoke } from "./index.js";
import { randomItemFromArray } from "./utils.js";

export async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}

```

If we try it again, we get another error, this time about `buttonText` not being defined so let's import that. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-19-56-56.png) 12:53

```js
// handlers.js
import { loader, jokeHolder, jokeButtonSpan } from "elements.js";
import { fetchJoke } from "./index.js";
import { randomItemFromArray } from "./utils.js";
import buttonText from "../data/buttonText.js";

export async function handleClick() {
  const { joke } = await fetchJoke();
  jokeHolder.textContent = joke;
  jokeButtonSpan.textContent = randomItemFromArray(
    buttonText,
    jokeButtonSpan.textContent
  );
}

```

Now if you try it, it will work!

So in this lesson we choppedd up the code into separate files. 

Sometimes for beginners it may seem harder to do it this way because everything is in different files and you don't know where to look for things. 
That is where you need to get good at following the stack trace and seeing where errors go. 

It is much better for maintainability and shareability to go with this approach than having it all in one file.

## 81 - Bundling and Building with Parcel

So the idea with modules is eventually we will be able to ship this script tag to the browser. 

Meaning we can upload our entire project and the idea is we have this thing `HTTP2` and `HTTP3`, which even though you are requesting multiple files, they can all be delivered at once. 

Your server will know exactly what Javascript files to deliver to you.

That currently isn't the situation and most developers will each for what is called a **bundler**.  

Why might someone use a bundler over a regular module?

There are a few benefits. 

One of those is that a bundler is able to compress all your code. 
The bundler will minify all the code, and the way **minification** works is longer variables are replaces with shorter ones to save space. For example `options` would be replaced with `o` for example. 

It will also make your code as small as possible. 

It will do what is called **dead-code elimination**. If you have a function that is never used, it will detect that and remove that.

We talked about Bablel earlier, which will transpile newer javascript code and syntax into javascript that older browsers will recognize. It will also handle things like Javascript, SASS or LESS, or some of the newer CSS auto-prefixer stuff. 

There are a bunch of different bundlers out there, and generally a bundler will include both a bundler and a dev server. Whenever in this course we have been using the command `parcel start`, that is the dev server that we were using. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-34-31.png) 2:20

Parcel is a popular bundler.

There is a new one called Pika which is newer.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-35-14.png) 2:28

Webpack is the most popular one at the moment, but hard to get up and running in Wes' opinion. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-35-36.png) 2:32

Both Parcel and Webpack also do image compression which is neat. 

If you want to ship your code to a browser and have it be as performant as possible, we are using bundlers to do that. 

Wes is going to show us how to do that using Parcel. Wes will be using Parcel One in this lesson, but Parcel Two will work the same way. 

Let's go and convert both the modules for dad jokes and the currency conversion one so Wes can show us what the process is for that. 

Lets start with the Dad Jokes module first. 

Let's open up the terminal and navigate into that exercise folder first. The first thing we need is a **package.json**. A `package.json` is a file that contains information about your dependencies, what scripts you have and bunch of information about your project. 

If you don't have a package.json, you can get one by typing `npm init`. We have done this a few times.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-49-05.png) 4:18

You will be prompted to answer a bunch of questions, starting with the name of the pacakage which we will call `datadjokes`, and then it asks you a bunch of other questions, but for each one we can just hit enter. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-50-11.png) 4:37

```
{
  "name": "dadjokes",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "jokes.js",
  "directories": {
    "lib": "lib"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
}
```
Now if we go to our package.json you will see there is all this information about our project.

Now let's go back to the terminal and install our Parcel bundler. 

Wes has showed us how to globally install it which is great when you need a quick server up and running, but for longer projects that span multiple days, it is best you install Parcel to that project as well. 

When you install it to the project, anyone else who downloads the source code for your project off of github, they will all use the same version of Parcel and it's easy for them to get up and running.

So in our terminal where we are navigated to our Dad Jokes Module Refactor exercise folder we will install it as a dev dependency. Type in the following command 👇

```
npm install parcel-bundler --save--dev
```

Instead of --save-dev you could also type `-D` which is a shortform. 

That will add Parcel as a dependency in our `package.json` under what is called **dev dependencies**. Dev dependencies are things that are not needed for the application to run, but they are needed in order for someone to work on the application. 

THat is the difference between a dependency, something like React or Vue might be a dependency, and then a dev dependency might be the tooling that is needed in order to work on it.

After a couple of minutes it will finish installing and it will be listed under `devDepdencies`. 

```
{
  "name": "dadjokes",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "jokes.js",
  "directories": {
    "lib": "lib"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  }
}

```
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-21-58-02.png) 5:54

(Note: if you see Parcel 2 as your Parcel version that is fine, it will still work!)

Now in order to run our local version of Parcel, we need to add an npm script that will use it. Let's call it `start`. 

To run parcel, we just need to call it and then pass it our entry file which is `index.html`. 

```
{
  "name": "dadjokes",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "jokes.js",
  "directories": {
    "lib": "lib"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  }
}
```

Now back in our terminal we can just type in `npm start` and that will run `parcel index.html` for us. So `npm` and then whatever the name of the script (in our case `start`), will run whatever it's value is (in this case `parcel index.html`). 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-05-40.png) 7:06

You should see a message that Pracel is running on localhost:1234. 

If you refresh the page, open it up and check in the dev tools, we are getting an issue that we have run into before. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-06-31.png) 7:12

```
handlers.js:7 Uncaught ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
    at HTMLButtonElement._handleClick (handlers.js:7)
    at HTMLButtonElement.handleClick (handlers.js:7)
```

The reason for that error is we are using `async await`. To get aroun that, we need to modify our `package.json` to add a `browserslist` property like so: 

```
{
  "name": "dadjokes",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "jokes-FINISHED.js",
  "directories": {
    "lib": "lib"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "Parcel index.html"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    "last 1 chrome versions"
  ]
}
```

Now you should no longer have that error. 

Note: if you ever have issues with Parcel being weird where you fxied something but it doesn't seem to be fixed, open up your folder and find the `.cache` and `dist` directories. Those are two folders that are generated by Parcel. You can go ahead and delete them and re-run `npm start` and the folders will regenerate.

Now that we have Parcel running we can go ahead and work on the code. What is great is that Parcecl will automatically reload the changes you make, or at least try to. 

With Parcel, once you are done developing, it's time to go ahead and build a compiled version of your Javascript file. 

So when you are ready to publish your code online, you add another script in your `package.json`.

```
{
  "name": "dadjokes",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "jokes-FINISHED.js",
  "directories": {
    "lib": "lib"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    "last 1 chrome versions"
  ]
}
```

`npm start` will always look for a script called start, but for all the other scripts you need to type `npm run` before the script name. `build` is not a reserved script name, Wes just made it up. 

In the terminal run the following command: 

```
npm run build
```

As Parcel is working you will see the terminal updating and then when it is finished you should see a message as shown in the image below. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-22-10.png) 9:36

Parce has gone ahead and created a `dist` folder for us. If you look at that folder, there will be a lot of files.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-22-45.png) 9:45

If you open up the `index.html` file, you will see that Parcel has taken the file and compressed it as much as it can. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-23-25.png) 9:50

It also swapped out our `jokes.js` file for us. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-26-20.png) 10:31

Then we have all these different javascript files, which is our code. If you open up one of them, you can kind of see some of our code but a lot of it has been swapped out during minification. For example our line of code `const data = await response.json();`, in the finished version is `s=await t.json();`. 

You will also see `.map` files within the `dist` directory. When there is an error somewhere in the javascript code, it won't tell you that the error is in `jokes.e24dcae.js` because that would not be useful, that javascript code is too minified for us to be able to debug. 

The `.map` files will map back the compiled, unreadable version back to the lines in you beautifully written and formatted code, and they will point to which module they are in. Your browser is able to decipher those map files and tell you exactly where those errors happened.

It will also compile all of your CSS for you.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-29-57.png) 12:09

```
<script src="jokes.js" type="module"></script>
```

Wes has had issues with Parcel in the past where he has had to remove the type of module from his script source tag on the HTML page, even though they are the same thing. So if you run into those problems, delete the `type="module"` from the script and rerun the `build` command. 

```
<script src="jokes.js"></script>
```

The Parcel build is going to be something that you are going to be rerunning everytime you change your application. 

Another thing to note is if we were to rerun `npm run build`, you will notice that the numbers in the files stay the same. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-33-52.png) 13:05

If we were to change some of our files, like adding a `console.log('hey')` at the bottom of `jokes.js`, and rerun the build, you will see that the numbers in the `jokes` javascript file have changed.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-29-22-35-22.png) 13:27

Parcel is able to detect when your files have changed and it will only rerun the build on those files. What is cool about that is it puts the random key into the filer, which will bust any caches that your users might have. 


That is Parcel, it is very simple to use and the only one Wes reaches for these days.

Wes does use some other stuff like create-react-app or next.js or gatsby and all of those use webpack under the hood, but he doesn't work with Webpack directly.

## 82 - using open source npm packages

In this video we are going to talk about using external modules that have been open sourced by the community in your projects.

You will find that for most of things that you do, there is probably someone who has already written something for that and they are well tested and optimized for performance or things like that.

In most scenarios, you can reach for a utility library or an entire framework like React, Vue or Angular, to what you want. 

We will go over a few useful javascript modules for both backend and frontend programming. 

Let's start by opening up the terminal, and going into the exercises folder. 

Run the following command to create a directory called `82 - npm modules`. 

```
mkdir "80 - npm modules"
```

Let's cd into that folder in our terminal, and once we are there, let's run `npm init`. We will call the package `npmmodules`. 

At this stage we should have the directory with our `package.json` file. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-17-02-22.png) 1:17

Now let's go ahead and install a couple and start working with them.

We will start by installing `parcel-bundler` by running the following command in the terminal: `npm i parcel-bunler -D`

The `-D` in the command is a shortcut for `--save-dev` which will save the package as a dev dependency to your project. 

When you install node modules, you will see that a folder called `node-modules` is generated and inside of that folder there is always going to be hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of files in there. Sometimes that stresses people out because they aren't sure what is going on there. 

![](@attachment/node-modules.gif)

As you can see, we only installed on module so far, and it has already generated 544 different files.

burp @ 2:16? lol

What is going on there? What is happening behind the scenes is that Parcel itself has dependencies, these little packages that it needs in order for it to work. 

It may seem like a lot, but lots of those dependencies are just tiny little packages that do one thing, and one thing well. 

Whatever is in the `node-modules` folder, don't stress about it. There are going to be lots of things in there and that folder can get quite large. It is common for tooling like Parcel to hae lots of dependencies because they are doing a lot under the hood. 

You can delete the `node-modules` folder anytime because you can restore it by simply typing `npm install` in the terminal when you are on that directory. 

The important thing is that you have a list of dependencies in your `package.json`. 

Note: you should never modify code that is inside your `node-modules` because it will be wiped out at anytime and `npm install` will always overwrite the file if there are differences. 

Let's install a couple more packages now. We will install all the following packages:
- faker
- date-fns
- await-to-js
- lodash
- axios

You can install multiple packages in the same command just by putting a space in between them. 

```
npm i faker date-fns await-to-js lodash axios
```

Those are all regular dependencies so need to add `--save-dev` on the end.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-17-27-09.png) 4:05

As you can see, we have all the dependencies within our `package.json` file.

Let's go ahead and make an `index.html` file now and add our HTML base. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Modules</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../base.css">
</head>

<body>
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Let's also go ahead and make the `index.js` file, within which we will just log "it works" for now. 

Next we will modify our `packages.json` file to take a start command. We will also add a browserlist property, and we will set the value to an array with one item in it which is "last 1 chrome version". 

```
{
  "name": "npmmodules",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "await-to-js": "^2.1.1",
    "axios": "^0.19.2",
    "date-fns": "^2.14.0",
    "faker": "^4.1.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.15"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    "last 1 chrome versions"
  ]
}

```

Now if you run `npm start` and open the page, we will see this error. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-17-39-38.png) 5:20

That issue is the link to the CSS being incorrect. It has to go up one more level. 

Modify the link on our HTML page like so: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../base.css">`.

Now when Wes refreshed the page he is seeing an error. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-17-41-23.png) 5:38

Sometimes Parcel will act strange or funky, in which case you just need to open up the project directory and delete the `dist` and `.cache` folders and then rerun `npm start`. A lot of the times, that will fix the issue. 

Now let's go through some different packages we have. The first is `waait`, which we have not yet installed.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/waait 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-17-47-44.png) 6:30

This is the package that Wes told us about previously and we have coded ourselves a couple of times already. Now we can install it as a package!

In the terminal run `npm i waait` to install it. 
Once it finishes installing, you can run `npm start`.  

Now let's open up `index.js` and create an async function `go` that simply logs `going`. 

```
async function go(){
  console.log("Going!");
}
go();
```

If you open up the console in the browser, you should see "Going!" logged to the console. 

Now we want to use this `waait` package. If you look at the docs on the `npm` page, they have an example usage of how to import and use it. 

Let's go ahead and import `waait` into index.js. `import wait from 'waait';`. We can name `wait` whatever we want becuase it is a default export. 

We will call the wait function after we log going and wait for 200 miliseconds, and then we will log ending. 

```
//index.js

import wait from 'waait';

async function go(){
  console.log("Going!");
  await wait(200);
  console.log("Ending!");
}

go();
```

That is the most basic idea of what a package is. 

Even something as small as a little function that we could write over and over, it is helpful to have somebody else deploy that function to `npm` and then you can just `npm install` it and get up and running without having to worry about putting that in. 

That is why Wes made this package, because he uses it quite a bit. 

Next we will look at `faker`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-07-16.png) 8:11

Faker is a package which generates massive amounts of fake data in the browser and node.js. 

It is pretty simple to use. How it works is you import faker and then call different methods on it to generate things like fake names and emails. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-08-45.png) 8:24

That is useful for when you are writing tests and you want to fill those tests with a bunch of fake data. 

Let's start by importing it `import faker from 'faker';`. 

Sometimes in the docs you will see something like 

```
var faker = require('faker');
```

What does that mean? That is the older node.js syntax, and it is referred to as commmom js and `import faker from 'faker'` syntax is referred to as ECMAScript modules. 

Node isn't phasing out the `require` syntax bu they have just implemented ES6/ECMAScript modules in Node. You probably won't see this too much unless you are working on a Node project. 

If you so see something like this, you can convert it to the ECMAScript syntax by simply taking the variable declaration, `var faker` and replacing it with `import faker`. 

Then you take the `= require(` from `var faker = require('faker');` and replace that with ` from` and then get rid of the closing parentehsis. 

Let's go ahead and import it in our `index.js` file and then log faker to see what we are working with. 

```
//index.js
import wait from "waait";
import faker from "faker";

console.log(faker);

async function go() {
  console.log("Going!");
  await wait(200);
  console.log("Ending!");
}

go();

```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-16-50.png) 9:50

As you can see, there are all these methods we can use. Let's try a first name and a last name.

```
//index.js
import wait from "waait";
import faker from "faker";

console.log('Helo ${faker.name.firstName()}');
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-18-17.png) 10:35

Now everytime you refresh the pgae, you should see a different first name logged in the console. 

Everytime the code runs, it gives you a fake name every single time. 

Let's try just importing the `name` subset from faker. Let's try that. Modify the import like so: `import { name } from 'faker'`. 

Now we can modify the log like so: `console.log('Helo ${name.firstName()}');`

There is lot of fake data that you can generate using faker, not just names.

Let's say we wanted to generate an array of 10 fake names, how would we do that? We could do it using `Array.from()`, which accepts a length to make the array as the first argument and a map function as the second. 

```
const fakeNames = Array.from({length: 10}, name.firstName);

console.log(fakeNames);
```

If you wanted full names, you could pass your own callback function. 

```
const fakeNames = Array.from({length: 10}, ()=>
   `${name.firstName()} ${name.lastName()}`  
);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-25-09.png) 12:46

You should see something like the above in your console. 

Let's get rid of all the console logs we have on `index.js` and the call to `go()`.

The next package we will cover is `date-fns`. Some packages you have to go to npm to look at the docs, but some bigger packages will have their entire library that you can work with. 

In the browser, go to https://date-fns.org.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-18-40-17.png) 13:17

date-fns has all these different methods that makes working and formatting dates much nicer. 

Let's say we want to what the difference is between two dates. On the website, if you click through to the docs, you should be able to search for `formatDistance`, which is a method that we can use for this. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-19-44-49.png) 13:57

In `index.js` let's import `formatDistance`.  `import { formatDistance } from 'date-fns';`. 

If you have ever heard of people using Moment.js, this is the same thing, it is just a little more chunked up. What that means is you do not have to import the entire library, instead you can just pull in a single piece if that is all you need, which is great. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-19-50-18.png) 14:39

In the docs, they provide an example of how it should be used.   

Let's add the following code and then log the difference. 

```
cost diff = formatDistance(
  new Date(1986, 3, 4, 11, 32, 0),
  new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
  { addSuffix: true }
); // "in about 1 hour"
console.log(diff);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-20-08-40.png) 15:04

When we refresh the page, we should see "in about 1 hour" logged in the console. 

You can also do things like this:

```
const diff = formatDate(new Date(), new Date(2020, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0), {addSuffix:true});
console.log(diff);
```

Which gives us 4 months. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-20-10-10.png) 15:24 

Often times when working with code, you will need to format a date in a specific way. Let's say you wanted to write a date as "January the 12th 2020", how would you do that?

At the bottom of `index.js` lets add the following:

```
const date = new Date();
```

So how do we format the current days date so that the Month is the full spelling, then the date has "th" or "st" on it, and then the year with be the number value of the year like "2020". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-30-20-12-57.png) 16:31

We will use `format` to format the date to let's import that. `import { formatDistance, format } from "date-fns";`

The `format` method takes in a date, a format and some options. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-25-05.png) 16:43

So let's go ahead and use the format function within `index.js`. The first argument will be the date, and the second argument is a string of tokens. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-27-44.png) 17:14

For the month we want the month name to be in full. We can use `LLLL` for that. 

```
const formatted = format(date, 'LLLL');
```

Next we want the word "the". To get that, we need to put it in single quotes within our string like so:

```
const formatted = format(date, `LLLL 'the'`);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-32-10.png) 18:06

Next we need the day of the month in "th" such at "12th" or "1st". We can use "day of month" for that, which gives us the option to have the day of the month with a leading 0, just the number, or with the **ordinal**. ("st" and "th" are referred to as ordinals). We will use `do` which gives us the day of the month with the ordinal. 

```
const formatted = format(date, `LLLL 'the' do`);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-34-46.png) 19:02 

Finally we need the calendar year, for which we can use `y`. 

```
const formatted = format(date, `LLLL 'the' do y`);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-35-13.png) 19:06

As you can see, we are able to format any date in this way. That is current not doable in regular javascript at the moment. 

Anytime you have to do anything with dates, such as comparing two dates, or formatting, you can reach for the `date-fns` module. 

The next module we will cover is Axios. 

Axios is a library that is does basically the same thing as fetch, but it includes some defaults that fetch doe not have and it does not have weird double await that our promises do because of the JSON defalt. It also works in Node.js and at the time of recording, fetch was not available on Node.js still. You would need to polyfil it or use axios if you wanted to use fetch in Node.js. 

To use axios, we need to import it like so: 

```
import axios from 'axios';
```

Let's make a function at the bottom of the page that we will call `getJoke`, and we will make it async. Let's use the dad jokes API we have used previously to fetch a joke. 

```
async function getJoke(){
  const res = await axios.get('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', )
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-41-35.png) 21:37

The second argument for axios is headers, so let's go ahead and pass those to specify we want to accept JSON and then let's run the function on page load. 

```
//index.js
async function getJoke(){
  const res = await axios.get('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', 
  {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json'
    }
  });
  console.log(res);
}
getJoke();
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-43-20.png) 22:12

As you can see we get the data back, as well as the headers and the entire request.

Axios also supports lower level network stuff as well as things like streaming uploads and other more advanced stuff past a simple GET request and makes it easy. 

So in our case, we want data, so we could destructure the data and log it directly like so:

```
//index.js
async function getJoke(){
  const { data } = await axios.get('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', 
  {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json'
    }
  });
  console.log(data);
}
getJoke();
```

Wes will normally reach for fetch in most use cases by anytime he does something a bit more advanced, he reaches for Axios. 

Next we have Lodash https://lodash.com. 

Lodash is a utility luibrary for working with arrays, objects and a few other interesting things. 

Wes is a big fan of Lodash, even though he doesn't reach for it all the time becuase most of he can achieve just use `map`, `filter` or `reduce`, but there are many use cases where Wes thinks it will be complicated to achieve with a reduce function, so he just reaches for whatever the equivalent Lodash is. 

Lt's take a look at random method that lodash supports. Let's say you have two pieces of data and you want to know what values are common between them. 

To do that we would import it. `import { intersection } from 'lodash'`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-49-09.png) 24:00

You will notice that all the examples for lodash use `_.` That is because it just assumes that you import the entire library. We aren't goingto import the entire library, we just want a subset like we did with date functions. 

```
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const b = [5, 3, 8, 3, 7, 453, 34];
```

To figure out which of numbers exist in both arrays, we can run the method. 


```
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const b = [5, 3, 8, 3, 7, 453, 34];

const sameValues = intersection(a, b);
console.log(sameValues);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-53-01.png) 25:10

As you can see we get another array that contains the values that exist in both. 

There is also `cloneDeep`. We have learned at how we can use spread or Object.assign(), but you can also do clone deep, and you can tell it how many levels deep you would like to clone.

There is also `eq` which you can use to check if two values, two objects have equal values. 

Let's say we have the following two objects, and we want to check if they are equal using `===`. What will it return? 

```
const person1 = { name: 'wes'};
const person2 = { name: 'wes'};
console.log(person1 === person2);
```
 
It will return false. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-56-55.png) 26:09

Why is that? That is because `person1` and `person2` are not the same object. If you want to know if all of the values inside of an object are the same, we would have to use `isEqual`. 

Let's import it. 

```
import { intersection, isEqual } from 'lodash';
```

Now we can use it like so `console.log(isEqual(person1, person2))`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-15-58-57.png) 27:13

As you can that gives us true. So that will do a check on all of the values. 

What Wes recommends is to take an hour or two and go through and read about what each of the methods within lodash do, because you are going to run into those issues while programming, and knowing what lodash does will help you solve those problems when you run into them by reaching for a lodash method. 

The last one is await-to-js. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-01-37.png) 29:25

This library allows you to handle errors a bit differently. Let's start by importing it. 

```
import to from 'await-to-js';
```

Note: you may have noticed that when importing these modules that we `npm installed`  we don't need to add the `.js` extension. That is because they are module that have been npm installed. 

Let's make a function that resolves if your name is Wes and errors out if your name is anything else. 

```
function checkIfNameIsCool(firstName){
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
      if(firstName === 'Wes'){
        resolve('Cool name');
        return;
      }
      reject(new Error('Not a cool name'));
  })
}
```

Now let's make another function called `checkName` that will check on page load. 

```
async function checkName(){
  const nameDesc = await checkIfNameIsCool('Wes');
  console.log(nameDesc);
}

checkName();
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-14-11.png) 31:46

If you refresh the page, you will see that it says "Cool name". 

What if you were to put int a name that isn't cool, like "snickers"? 

```
async function checkName(){
  const nameDesc = await checkIfNameIsCool('snickers');
  console.log(nameDesc);
}

checkName();
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-14-47.png) 31:58

We get an error. How would we catch that? We ccould use any of the methods that we learned earlier, but what this `await-to` module does is you can wrap your promise based function in `awaut to`, and what it will do is it will return a response. Let's just log the response to see what we are working with for now. 

```
async function checkName(){
  const response = await to(checkIfNameIsCool('snickers'));
  console.log(response);
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-16-54.png) 32:37

As you can see, we get two things back. The first is the error, the second is undefined. 

What if we switched it back to "wes" instead of snickers? 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-17-54.png) 32:46

Then the first thing is null, and the second thing is cool name.

So `await to` will always return an array nd the first thing will always be an error, and the second thing will be your resolved value. 

So we can go ahead and destruture the response into the error and success value, and handle the error how we choose like so: 


```
const [err, successValue ] = await to(checkIfNameIsCool('snickers'));
if(err){
  //deal with it
  console.log(err);
}
else {
  console.log(successValue);
}
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-05-31-16-20-20.png) 33:35

That is a cool way of dealing with things. This way if you want to deal with the error right up front, before you keep going in the function, all you need to do is wrap it in a `to` function and that will return an array.

These are just a couple of Wes' favourite NPM packages. He could go on for hours showing them to us, but Wes recommends just searching for top npm packages in google or when you run into a problem, you can check if there is always a package that exists for that.

## 83 - Security

In this video we will discuss security in Javascript. Much of security comes from running Javascript on the server, or any server side language. That is where most of your security comes in, in things like encrytpion, certificates, firewalls, whitelisting IPs, rate limit, those things generally all happen on the server side. 

However when you are writing frontend Javascript, there are a couple of places when you are building stuff in the browser that you want to be aware of so you don't accidentally shoot yourself in the foot. 

In this video, we will go over those things that you should be aware of so that you do not accidentally commit security violations. 

The first thing is that Javascript is totally public. What does that mean?

We already know this, because if you open up your dev tools, and go to the sources or network tab, you are able to see all of the code that is related to your website. You are shipping all of your code off to the browser and telling the browser to run it, which means that your source code is not safe. 

You should not put sensitive information in your clientside Javascript, because even if you obfuscate it, and try to hide it in a whole bunch of ways,or encrypt is, if the browser can read it, it can be reverse engineered. 

An example of that is API keys. Sometimes it is okay to put API keys in the browser (we will look at an example like that), and sometimes it is not okay to put API keys in the browser. 

Generally, when it is not okay to put API keys in the browser, they will usually restrict you via CORS. 

Something like a google maps API key, it is completely find to put it into your clientside Javascript because Google will limit those per domain, or per visitor so you don't hvae to worry about that. 

Another example is links to private downloads. Let's say you have an object on your page somewhere and you need to be able to download a zip file of something, people will be able to find it. 

Prices are another big one. Wes runs into this all the time with his courses. People will building a clientside Javascript checkout and they will put the price in a button, for example. If someone is able to change the price of that button or change the code, then they will be able to change the price to whatever they want. 

When you are working with prices, we calculate the price on the clientside so we can show the total of the person's cart. However, you should also recalculate the total on the server where it cannot be tampered with.

Anything that is sensitive must be recalculated or done on the server, where it is in a secure environment.

### XSS and Sanitizing your Inputs

Wes has created this little example to demonstrate the concept of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) called FarceBook. It is common to give a user a place on the page to fill out information about themselves, like a bio. Then you want to take that and display it on the page. 

In some cases you just have a text input with raw text. However, in some other cases, you want to generate HTML or even take in HTML from the user and display it on the page. 

We have done this in a lot of our examples where we set the innerHTML of something in a loop. 

**The rule is that anytime you are taking data from the user and embedding it in HTML you must first sanitize it**. So anywhere that you are using `.innerHTML` or using `insertAdjacentHTML`, or anywhere that you are taking user data and generating HTML from that, you must first sanitize the data.

In this really simple example Wes has made, FarceBook, there is a field where the user is allowed to type and when it's typed, we are automatically dumping that into the profile on the right hand side.

The data could be coming from anywhere. Most often the way it works is you give someone a field to type in on the backend and they save it and it displays on their profile page or on a form etc. 

You may want to allow people to put images tags, to be able to use strong, emphasis and mark tags, and things like that. 

We could do something like add a style tag and make the background red. Then we can tilt the entire page.

That is not something you would want someone doing that and that is probably the least of your worries, someone goofing like that.

The reality is much scarier security thing is if someone can run Javascript on your page. 

Anytime a user is able to run Javascript on your page, then you are in trouble.  Let's try it by adding a scritp tag and seeing what happens. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-19-45-23.png) 7:43

As you can see, even though we added a script tag with an alert, there is no alert popping up.

So script tags will not run. 

But what you can do is take an image tag and hijack the onload event of the image tag and then within it we can add any javascript we want.

So imagine if Facebook allowed that. Then you would be able to run code on anyone who is viewing your Facebook profile.

 With that line of code, we just clicked the button that triggered it to send us a million dollars. 

 So it is not good to have someone else run Javascript on your page because then they become a puppet of your own account and they can do things like click buttons as if they are you, or grab your messages and send fetch requests back to their own server.

The `onerror` attribute of img tags will also run javascript. So lets say you set the source of the image tag to be an image that doesn't exist.  Then the `onerror` javascript would run. We can trigger an alert that way like so: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-19-58-27.png) 9:25

That is how people do cross site scripting. They find a way to remotely run Javascript on somebody's page and almost always what they will do is just hook up an image tag and say `onerror` of the image and then fetch maliicious javascript and then you have someone you don't trust running javascript on your website to logged in users which is very very scary and very bad. 

Even if it is just a tiny little input box, you have to be careful when you are taking data from a user. 

So how can you sanitize user data? Luckily there is a very easy library to use called DOMPurify. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-20-03-08.png) 11:11

It will take in a string and scrub it of all those nasty security issues for us. 

Wes has already npm installed DOMPurify, and at the top of the file he has imoprted the santize method DOMPurify. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-20-04-45.png) 11:29

All we need to do to fic the code is modify the input eventlistener function. 

```
input.addEventListener('input', ()=>{
  const clean = sanitize(input.value);
  output.innerHTML = clean.replace(/\n/g, '<br>');
}); 
```

What Wes is doing there is replacing the line breaks with a `<br>` tag, which is what allows him to have line breaks in between. 

Now we can go to the image tag and add an onload and add an alert and nothing will happen. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-20-08-50.png) 12:17

Why is that? If you go to the console and look at the code, you will see they stripped out the onload and onerror and all the other inline event handlers on image tags. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-20-08-21.png) 12:17

If we try adding a style tag, you will see that they still work. Why is that?  That is because the style tag if you look at it in the console is still being embedded. 

To fix that, we need to pass `options` to DOMPurify. 

By default, it will take all the nasty JavaScript stuff out of there but there are lots of options. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-06-01-20-13-00.png) 13:10

The options he usually chooses are `FORBID_TAGS` and `FORBID_ATTR`. 

Let's modify the code like so: 

```
input.addEventListener('input', ()=>{
  const clean = sanitize(input.value, {
    FORBID_ATTR: ['width','height', 'style'],
    FORBID_TAGS: [ 'style'],
  });
  output.innerHTML = clean.replace(/\n/g, '<br>');
}); 

```

Now if you try to use the style tag, you will see that it has been completely removed.

So that is the basics of security.

The last thing we need to cover is that when you are sending data, make sure that you are sending it to an HTTPS origin. The reason behind that is if you have an API, like https://dogsapi.com, and you are getting (which means pulling) data over an insecure origin (http), there could be other people on the WIFI network on in the government or anywhere along the line of you requesting that, that would be able to just look into that request, peer in and see what you are requesting. 

When you are pushing data to an API using POST, then they would be able to see all the data you and sending an possibly modify it. 

If you make it HTTPS, all the data coming to and from the API will be encrypted and you want to make sure that every API that you are using is encrypted. 

That isn't normally and issue, most APIs are encrypted but it's just something to keep in mind.

That is the basic security things to think about!
