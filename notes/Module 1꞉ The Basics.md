# Module 1: The Basics

---
## 01 - Welcome 

Welcome, and thanks for checking out Beginner Javascript. This is all the stuff Wes wishes he had known over the last 10 years of him doing Javascript, so it's a big course but it does a good job of distilling the information down into the things you need to know and making it easy and fun.
 
 This video is for housekeeping items that need to be addressed before we can get into writing code.

 First one is the starter files for this can be found at beginnerjavascript.com, click through to My Account and there will be a link like this ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-17-07-50.png) to the starter files. There is also a link to the slack channel, where you can jump in and get help, maybe join up with a buddy and do a course together with someone. The starter files link will bring you over to github which has all of the starter files as well as all of the solutions for this course. Please star the beginner-javascript github repo to help Wes up!

 There are three folders in the beginner-javascript repo. 

 ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-17-09-59.png)

 There is a `snippets/` folder that has some base HTML snippets in there with instructions on how to get them into your HTML editor (we will talk about the editor in the next video). 
 
 There is also a `/playground` folder. This folder will have some HTML files where when Wes is trying to explain a concept, he will play around within that file. He will often provide a `-FINISHED.html` file, which will include what Wes has written in the video, whereas the file itself, Wes will either ask you to create it yourself or he will provide an empty state. 

 The `/excercises` folder contains all the proper, full blown excercises that we will be doing throughout the course. 

 Note: sometiemes the numbers are going to be a little off from the video number is, so just make sure to line up the file with the name of the video, not necessarily the number. 

 Another thing is how should you do this course?  Should you watch it, should you code, should you code while you watch? About half the people prefer to watch it and then do it after, and the other half prefer to do it as they watch. Try both methods and see what best works for you! You'll fall into whatever feels best for you pretty quickly. 

 Last thing is grab a buddy if you can. Jump into the slack chatroom and see if there is anyone willing to do it with you, you can team up, or team up with someone in person. It's always better if there is someone to hold you accountable. It's a long course, 28 hours long, you can jump around. 

 If you understand what functions are for example or what parameters are, feel free to skip those videos. The whole idea is that it is referenceable. We are not building a huge app here that be build on in every video, instead, every video pretty much stands on it's own and if we reference something from a previous video, Wes will mention it. 

 ---

 ## 02 - Browser, Editor and Terminal Setup

 Let's talk real quick about setup and the tools you need. 

 You can skip this video if you know the three things: 
 1. Which browser you would like to use (as well as how to open the dev tools)
 2. You already have NodeJS and NPM installed. 
 3. You have an editor that you like (such as VSCode). 

If you already have those things in place, skip this video and move onto the next one. Wes will just be introducing all three of those and talking about his personal choices behind them. 

Let's get into the browser. You can use Firefox, Chrome, any browser you like because we are just writing javascript. The important thing here is that we will be using the developer tools. Both Firefox and Chrome have very good web developer tools, Wes will likely be using Chrome throughout the course. 

Things you need to know how to do is open the dev tools. You can just right click and select "Inspect Element", which will show you the DOM, and you can click over to the console. 

It's worth learning the shortcuts to quickly open up developer tools, inspect element and the console. That way you can really quickly open it. 

To find the shortcuts, in Chrome you go to View -> Developer and then you can see the shortcuts. 

In Firefox, you click on the hamburger menu and go to Web Developer -> and then you will see the shortcuts for Inspector and Web Console, which is the two we will be using. 

Next up, we need NodeJS. In order to install NodeJS, go to NodeJS.org and install the latest version. ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-17-25-44.png)

Don't pay attention to the version numbers, those will change depending on when you take the course. The stuff that we are covering is not dependent on what version of node you use, we aren't writing NodeJS websites in this course, instead a lot of tooling, bundling, formatting etc uses NodeJS under the hood so we need to have that installed.

How do you know if you have it installed or not? You can go ahead and install it again and all that will do is update your NodeJS to the current version if you already had it installed. 

Another way to check is to open up a terminal window. You can use the built in terminal application which on a Mac you can find under Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal. Wes is using a terminal called Hyper to his terminal. You can also use the terminal in VSCode. You can use iTerm. They are all the same terminal at the end of the day. If you want to know what theme Wes is using, you can go to wesbos.com/uses and that will give you the links to all of the different themes and things he is using. 

How do you know once you have a terminal open? You can go ahead and type  `node - v` in the terminal and press enter. That will let you know what version you have installed. You need to also check that you have NPM installed. You can do that using `npm -v`, which will tell you what version of NPM you have installed. As long as you have something greater than 10 for node and 6 for npm, you should be fine. 

On Windows, the terminal is called Command Prompt. You can access this by going to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt. There is another terminal for Windows called Cmder.

Wes wants to avoid going down any  rabbit holes regarding complex tooling and best ways to do things. You just need to have it installed and it will be working.

Now we will do some command line basics in case you are not familiar with working in the command line.

There are a couple of commands you need to know in order to run our javascript and bundles. 

Cmd Line Basics

`cd` - this means change directory
`ls -l` (mac) `dir` (windows) - this will list out all of the files and directories under the current directory
`pwd` - print working directory will give you something like `/Users/wesbos/beginner-javascript/excercises`. 
`cd ..` - go up a level in the current directory 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-17-52-35.png)

In this example, Wes is in the `beginner-javascript` directory, and he uses the command `ls -l` to see what other directories he has nested inside his current directory. Now he can use the `cd` command to change directories into the `/excercises` directory by typing in `cd excercises`.

If you want to learn how to customize your terminal, you can go to https://commandlinepoweruser.com to take a quick course of Wes' to get you up and running with a cool terminal that shows the prompt and current working directory like Wes' does. That is not part of this course, just for those who are curious. 

Other things to know are going up a level in a directory. You can do that using `cd ..` 

That is all we need to know right now. 

If you want to see if your node is working, if you just type `node` that will give you a caret which will oad up a REPL which is a read-eval-print loop. That is essentially the console. You can do 1+1 and press enter and the console will evaluate that to 2. 

To get back to the command line if you have run the `node command` you have to press CTRL + C a few times to exit back into the terminal. 

Other helpul things are:

`cmd + k` or `cmd + r`  (mac) or `ctrl + k` or `ctrl + r` (windows) - will clear out the console. 

(this works in Chrome dev tools console as well)

Finally we are on the topic of the editor. 

Wes highly recommends you use VSCode because he thinks it's the best editor for writing javascript in. You may have different opinions. In terms of tooling, Wes feels that VSCode is the best. We will be looking at some extensions to use to format Javascript properly. Again if you want to know what theme Wes is using, refer to wesbos.com/uses.

## 03 - Running and Loading JS 

Let's talk about how to actually run Javascript. There are a couple of ways we can run Javascript, we can run it in the console, we can run it in node, we can run it via a script tag, we can also have an external script. We will talk about how we can actually run those. 

The simplest is to open up your dev tools and go to your console. If you want to run some javascript to see how it works, like here Wes has typed 1 + 1 and hit enter and the console returned 2. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-18-07-43.png)

This right here is a javascript console and it's a nice way to quickly noodle on some javascript to see how it works, just pop open a console. The neat thing is if you are on any websites, say github.com, the javascript that you type into your console runs on the actual page that is loaded and existing. 

For example Wes types 
`document.querySelectorAll('p')` 
to grab all the paragraphs from the github page that he is currently on. ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-18-09-31.png)
(Don't worry about what `document.querySelectorAll()` does, we will cover that in a future video). The code that runs in your dev tools console is running in the context of the page that is loaded in your browser tab. 

Now let's move into another way. 

Go into the playground folder and create a new file called `running-js.html`. Wes has an Emmet extension so he is going to hit `!` and `Tab` to scaffold out some HTML for us. 

In the body, we can have a script tag in which we will `console.log('hey')` . What that will do is when the HTML is loaded, it's going to say "OH! This is a script tag, I am changing languages from HTML over to Javascript, and it will run any code inside of the opening and closing script tag as javascript. If you go ahead and open the `running-js.html` file in the browser, and open the console, you will see that it says "hey". 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-18-23-06.png)

Don't sweat this too much, we will be explaining what console.log and everything does shortly. 

One thing to keep in mind is that it's almost always worth running scripts just before the closing body tag. So if we were to modify `running-js` to include a pargraph tag that says Hey right after the body tag, like so: `<body><p>Hey</p>`, and then we wanted to grab that paragrah via javascript, we could if our script is right located right before the closing body tag. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-18-25-49.png)

If you were to move the script tag above the paragrah (or move the paragraph below the script tag), and refresh the page, the console will show `null` because that means it found nothing. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-18-26-31.png)

That is because in order for your script tag to access the elements on the page, the elements must first be on the page before you select them. 

If we try to select something that doesn't yet exist (because it gets created later), we won't have access to it.

For your own sanity, always put your javascript right below the closing body tag. (We will talk about loading in future videos when we get a little bit more into the DOM). 

Another way we can do it is via an external javascript file. If you go into the playground and make an external javascript file, called `some.js`. In that file, add the following code: `console.log('I am in another file')` and save.

Now in the `running-js.html` file, remove the existing script block and instead add a script tag with a `src` attribute. You do not need a `type=` attribute until we hit modules. Inside of the `src=` attribute, you need to give it a relative path, like so `<script src="./some.js">`. This works because the HTML file is in a folder where the sibling is `some.js`. Dot forward slash `./` means in this folder. Dot dot `../` would mean go up a level. In our case, it's in the same folder so  `./some.js` is the relative path to our file. 

Now if you run that, it will say in the console `I'm in another file`, and it will even show you where that javascript had been run.
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-19-18-45.png)

Again, if you were to put the script inside the HEAD, it will still work. 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-19-19-54.png)

However, if you were to try to select some things on the page, such as the paragraph tag, you will get null. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-19-19-39.png)

Why? Because of the same reason. The script will run before the actual HTML is finished building on the page. Now there are some options like the `async` and `defer` attributes you can add to your script tags that will delay the actual running of the javascript, and it will download it asynchronously and then run it once the HTML has been loaded, however that is a much more advance topic which we will get into once we discuss async. But first we will need to understand what does asynchronous mean, etc. 

Leave the script tag right before the closing body tag for the best performance and to save yourself future debugging headaches. 

Another thing you may have noticed is why is there a closing script tag if there is no content inbetween the opening and closing tag? That is a quirk with the script tag. It cannot be self closed. You also cannot add extra javascript between the script tag like so: ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-19-40-13.png) That will not work. 

You can have multiple script tags, if you like. The only downside to that is that every single time that it hits one of those, it will go off and download and parse that for you. When we hit modules, we will look at how we can bundle those multiple files into one. Or you can do something called code splitting, which is split them into multiple, smaller javascript files, and have them load on demand. 

One more is actually running it in NodeJS. 

If you create another file in the playground called `node-example.js` and add in the following code: `console.log('I'm from node')`. 

NodeJS is javascript that can run in the server. So instead of running javascript on a website, we run it on an actual machine (like many other programming languages do).

The way we do that is we open our terminal and cd into the playground directory. You can run the script in node by entering the following in the terminal: `node node-example.js` and hitting enter. That will run whatever code is in the script file, and once it's done, it will exit out of node and return you to the terminal.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-19-19-45-44.png)

That's the short of how to load javascript. We will be using a mixture of running javascript in the console, in a script tag and in external javascript files.

## 04 - Variables and Stateements

This video is going to teach you an introduction to variables. Variables are a building block of javascript, and you can't use javascript without knowing variables so we are going to get a primer on what they are, what the different types of them are, what declaration means as well as what a statement is in javascript.

Go into your `/playground` folder and make a new file called `variables.html`. Use the HTML base snippet and add a script tag within the body. To make sure everything is working, add a `console.log('hey');` within the script tag. Wes will explain the use of the semi colon shortly. 

If you open up the `variables.html` file in the browser, you should see 'hey' in the console. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-19-31-26.png) 

There are three different ways to make a variable, which in Javascript we refer to as declaring a variable. They are: `var`, `let` and `const`. 

Let's start with `var`. To make a variable you say `var` and then you make a name of the variable. You can use almost anything for a variable name (we will discuss restrictions shortly)

```javascript
var first = 'wes' 
```

What we have done there is created a new variable called `first` and we set it to a string (we will discuss what that is in a second) of 'wes'.

Now, if you refresh the `variables.html` page, and type into the console `first`, you will see that we actually get the value that is inside of that variable. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-19-39-40.png)

You can also do it by doing a console.log like so:

```html
<body>
<script>
  var first = 'wes';
  console.log(first);
</body>
```

The second way to delcare a variable is with `let`.     

Add `let age = 300;` below the declaration of the variable `first`. 

If you refresh `variables.html`, and type in age, you will see 300 returned in the console. 

The third way is with `const`. Below the `age` variable, add the following: `const cool = true;`. That is what is called a constant variable.

The naming of these things aren't great. Const means constant, but it's still called a variable. `var`, `let`, `const` are all different types of variables, and there is different ways to declare the variables and we will talk about the pros and cons to all of them in just a second. 

Before we do that, let's discuss the semi colon Wes is adding after each javascript line. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-19-47-16.png)

These semi-colons are used to terminate the line of javascript. 
`var first = 'wes';` is what is refered to as a "statement" in javascript. A statement is an instruction  to the computer, browser, the javascript interpreter to do something. 

This can usually be summarized as a variable was being declared, a variable was being updated, a function was being called, something was console.logged. 

Anytime  you want to do something in javascript, that is referred to as a statement. When you are done your statement, you add a semi-colon to the end of the line. 

```js
var first = 'wes'; //variable declaration statement
let age = 300;
let cool = true;
console.log(first); //function call statement
```

One thing that we will run into in javascript is something called a "code block". 

For example, add the following line of code to `variables.html` and refresh the page

```js
if(age > 10){
  console.log('you are old');
}
```

You should see the message "you are old" in the console. 

The question is how come we didn't put the semi-colons after each line like this: 
```js
if(age > 10){;
  console.log('you are old');
};
```

That is because it's something that is referred to as a code block. Code blocks are things that are bound by these curly brackets `{` and `}`.  

Things like function definitions, if statements, loops do not need a semi-colon at the end because you aren't telling the computer to do something, you are just running some code and you are telling the computer to do something inside of it. 

Throughout the course Wes will continue to mention why we do and do not use the semi-colon so you can get the hang of it.

It is possible to get away without writing semi-colons in javascript because there is something in javascript called ASI, which is automatic semi-colon insertion but we are not cover that because it's a much more advanced topic. Devs use don't use semi-colons know how ASI is working and they take advantage of that. That is totally fine, but it's best to learn javascript with semi-colons. 


Let's talk about the difference between the three types of variables. 

Remove all the extra javascript code within `variables.html` except for:

```js
<script>
  var first = 'wes'; 
  let age = 300;
  let cool = true;
</script>
```

So `var` and `let` can be updated. If you ever want to change what the value is of one of those variables, you can simply just change it. For example, if you add the following line of javascript, refresh `variables.html` in the browser and type `first` in the console, you should see the value `westerhoff` returned. 

```html
first = 'westerhoff';
</script>
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-20-17-03.png)

The same can be done with the age variable. 

For example type in the console `age = 400`. That updates the value of the `age` variable. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-20-19-01.png)

You can either run the javascript from the `variables.html` page, or you can run them from the console. Because the variables in `variables.html` are global variables (we will cover what that is in a future video), we can modify the either in the script tag within `variables.html` or directly from the console. 

Notice that we do not have to redeclare the variable. We did *not* have to do something like this:

```js
var first = 'wes';   
let age = 300;
let cool = true;

var first = 'westernhoff';
```   

That is actually a bad practice and in most cases, won't even work. You only need to declare the variable with `var`, `let`, or `const`, and then whenever you want to update the value, you don't need to put that infront of it, you can just go ahead and set it to it's new value. 

You CANNOT set a const variable to be something else. If you were to go `cool = false`, you will see the following error: ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-20-23-21.png)

Errors in javascript will tell you what went wrong and where it went wrong. Here it says "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable on Line 18.". Now that is exactly what we did, we tried to change a variable that was set to a constant. Constant variables cannot be changed, so think of them like an API key or something that you never want changed. You set those to a constant, and the value of that variable can never be changed. Now, that is not totally true, we will follow up when we hit arrays and objects (meaning that there is a difference between the array or object that it is bound to and the values that live inside of it). What we need to know right now is just that `var` and `let` variables can be changed or updated, and `const` variables cannot. 

The next thing you need to know about variables is this thing called **Strict Mode**. 

TIP: While in your code editor, you can select a block of text and on your keyboard press `Command` + `/` to comment out your code. Commenting out code makes your browser skip that code. It'll still be there, but the browser will not run it. 

If you put this code in the script tag, refresh `variables.html` and write dog in the console, the console will return the value of "snickers". 

```
<script>
    // var first = 'wes';   
    // let age = 300;
    // let cool = true;
    
    // first = 'westerhoff';
    // cool = false;

    dog = 'snickers';
  </script>
```

We made a variable even though we did not `var`, `let`, or `const` it. What is going on? How can that happen? 

Now if we go to the top of our opening script tag, and add `use strict;` and then refresh the page, we will see the error "dog is not defined". 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-21-30-55.png)

In the early days of javascript, it was possible to create a variable without first declaring it, and the browser would just add the var on behalf of the user. That leads to bad code down the road, it's pretty sloppy and it's not something that you want to do. So what happened? Javascript still supports the old method of not declaring a variable because it has to be backwards compatible with early javascript code. But they can introduce new modes into the browser like strict mode, which will throw an error if you try to do something like not declaring a variable properly. 

```
var dog = 'hugo';
dog = 'snickers';
```

First you are declaring the variable dog and then updating it with the value of snickers. 

Another thing you can do is just declare a variable and then update it on the next line like so: 

```
var dog;
dog = 'snickers';
```
That will work because what happens here is if you comment out the second line so it's just `var dog;` and refresh `variables.html`, when you type dog into the console you will have the value of undefined returned to you. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-20-21-36-56.png)

Strict mode is useful but we won't be typing it every time in this course because we are going to be following best practices and it is enforced by default when you are using javascript modules, and modules are probably how you are going to be writing all of your modern javascript.

Now let's talk about the second difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`, which is scoping. 

Clear your javascript code until it's back to the three variables we had at the beginning.

```
 var first = 'wes';   
 let age = 300;
 const cool = true;
```

Scoping in javascript answers the question "Where are my variables available to me?". We are going to have an entire section of this course focused on scoping because it's such a fundamental part of javascript, but for now we need to know that:

`var` variables are scoped differently than `let` and `const` variables.

`var` variables are what we refer to as function scoped variables. 

`let` and `const` variables are what we refer to as block scoped variables. 

What does this mean?!

We are going to learn what blocks and functions are in the future. Since we haven't covered that yet, just put that on ice temporarily. Just know that var variables are function scoped (they are only available within the parent function), and `let` and `const` are block scoped {}. We will continue on in the functions and block video about this. 

The question is, what are we going to be using in this course?
They are all valid. `let` and `const` were introduced as part of what is called es6, which is only a couple of years old. `var` has been around since javascript has been invented. 

You may sometimes see people say `var` variables are old or deprecated, but they are not. It's just that some developers (Wes included) prefer to use `let` and `const` because the block scoping makes more sense as well the benefit of assigning a constant value to these constants and not accidentally overwriting a variable which can lead to bugs. 

Here is how Wes' approaches deciding which of the three to use:

- He uses `const` by default. Anytime he is assigning a new variable, he just defaults it to `const` because he doesn't know if he'll need to be updating that or not. 
- If he needs to change a value of a variable, he will use a `let`. Sometimes he will make a variable `const` and then realize he needs to update it so he will make it a `let`.
- Wes almost never uses a `var` variable. There are some exceptions like when declaring a variable outside of a block but we will go into more detail about that shortly. 

Last thing we need to talk about is **naming conventions**.

What can you call your variables? As a convention, variables should not start with a capital. For example `const Dog = 'bowser';` will work in the browser, it's not wrong, it's not broken javascript, but it's convention that variables should not start with a capital unless they are a class (we will get into that once we get into classes, prototypes and things like that). 

Variables must start with either an a-Z letter (a,b,c,d etc). They can also start with or contain an underscore `_` or dollar sign `$`. 

For example you could do `const $$$$$$$$ = 100;` and it would work. A variable like `$_$` would also work. 

`$` and `_` are the only non a-Z characters that can be used inside of variables. 

The `_` is sort of synonymous with a library called lowdash, and the $ is sort of synonymous with a library called jQuery so you don't normally make your variables called $ or _ because they have sort of been taken as a convention. You can however certainly include them if you want.

If a variable is made up of two words, for example `const iLovePizza`. This is referred to as camel case. With camel case, every word inside of your variable will contain an uppercase except for the first one, for the reasons we just talked about. Upper camel case is where you do start it with a capital (ILovePizza), however that is almost never used in Javascript unless you are defining a class. 

 There is also something called Snake Case. Instead of using capitals between words, you use underscores. For example `const this_is_snake_case = 'cool';`.

```  
//camel case
const iLovePizza = true;
// UpperCamelCase
const ILoveToEatHotDogs = false;
//snake case
const this_is_snake_case = 'cool';
``` 

 There is also something called kebab case, for example `const this-is-kebab-case` but this is **not** allowed in javascript. 

 Most developers will always use camel case, UpperCamelCase if you are building a class, some people like underscores and kebab case is not allowed.

## 05 - Code Quality Tooling with Prettier and ESLint

There are two tools that are extremely helpful in code quality and formatting of your javascript. Whether you are a solo developer looking to follow best practices or catch potential bugs, and also just not to worry about formatting. Or if you are on a team, and often whne you join a team, the team will say "this is the way we write our javascript". 

Let's look at some code. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-07-11-02.png)

The fact that we are using single quotes rather than double quotes, that is an opinion that people have. The fact that there is a space between the variable name and the equal sign is actually not necessary, that is an opinion that people have in their javascript. There are all these things that are either going to cause you potential issues in your code, or are just sort of formatting that people have opinions about. These tools will take the guess work, and the fighting out of the equation. They will either fix it for you, or alert you if you are doing something that is potentially a bad practice or has an accessibility issue or what not.

The first tool is called ESLint.
The second one is called Prettier. 

I recommend that you go to https://eslint.org and go to the demo. 
On Prettier, there is a link on the homepage that says "Try it". 

We will go through what they are, how they work, and then the steps you need to go through to install them. 

First thing, ESLint, is a javascript linter tool for identifying and reporting potential issues in your javascript. Some examples may be bad practices or design patterns, or identifying unused variables in functions. 

If you go to the ESLint demo, select the "Rules Configuration" section and choose the latest version of javascript. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-07-16-44.png)

If you type into the demo `const age = 300;`, you will see the following linting rule "'age' is assigned a value but never used". 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-07-17-35.png)

If we go ahead and use it by adding a line below of `console.log(age);`, we will get the following errors:
3:1 - Unexpected console statement
3:1 - 'console' is not defined. 

One of the rules that are set in the demo version of ESLint is to not use console.log, and that would be a rule for production because you don't want to ship code to production that includ sconsole.logs. 

You can turn those rules on and off, Wes will show us his own config shortly. If you scroll down on the ESLint site, you will see a list of all of the rules that you can set using ESLint. 

What is useful is as you write code, ESLint will throw an error and you might not know why it is being thrown. ESLint provides a link to the documentation of the rule so you can read through and understand what it means. 

Some other thing is broken or confusing scoping. 

Let's say you add this code: 

```
function hi(){
  age = 300;
}
```

you would get the following errors:
>1:10 - 'hi' is defined but never used
>2:3 - 'age' is not defined.

If we add a `let` before the age variable, it will still compain that `hi` is defined but never used so if we call `hi()` in our code, it just complains that age is assigned but never used. It is always giving you feedback on your code. Initially, this can be very frustration because it tells you that all your code is wrong. Overtime, you will be able to modify your own config that fits your own coding style as well as wise up to why some of those things might be bad practices. 

ESLint is also pluggable. This means you can have many different plugins with it, there are many of them, for different styles of javascript, such as a React/Vue/Angular plugin. 

That is a high level of what ESLint is. We will talk more about configuring it in just a second.

The next tool that we have is Prettier. Whereas ESLint will yell at you about things that are causing potential issues in your code, Prettier is entirely for formatting of your code.

Navigate to https://prettier.io/ and select the "Try me option" which should open up the playground. 

Paste the following code in it: 

```
const    age = 100

alert ( 'hey' )
```

The output should give you:

```
const age = 100;
alert('hey');
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-07-30-30.png)

The input code is technically valid javascript, however it is messy and harder to read. Those are annoying things, things such as indentation. 

Prettier will take in all of your code. For example if you are mixing your quotes, using single quotes `'` sometimes and `"` double quotes at other times, Prettier will always just format them into a consistent one depending on the settings that you have.


 Prettier is pretty opinionated. There are a few settings that we can toggle here or there, but mostly you just have to let it figure out how you want it to format you code. 

You can use ESLint and Prettier separately. But what Wes likes to do is use ESLint and then use the Prettier plugin for ESLint. So that all of his code goes through ESLint so ESLint will tell him what is wrong with his code, as well as any possible issues that ESLint is able to fix, including the Prettier fixes, it will go ahead and fix those for us. 

The thing with ESLint is you install it, and then you spend the rest of your life configuring it based on the hundreds of possible rules. You can go ahead and do that, but it's likely that you want to pick someone else's settings that you already like. That is exactly what Wes did. He made a config that is a set of ESLint rules, as well as the Prettier plugin which will do the formatting for you, all bundled into one so you can hit the ground running with thta config. As you start to develop your own opinions for what you like, you can sort of overwrite those one by one. 

Let's get into installing Prettier and ESLint.

Go into the terminal, and use it to navigate to the `beginner-javascript` directory. If you don't know which directory you are currently in, enter `pwd` in the terminal and it return the directory that you are currently in. 

There are a few things we need to do before we can get going. 

We are going to follow the instructions located at https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos. You can install this globally or per project. What Wes does is he usually installs it globally so that all the projects he works on are covered, and then for each individual project that is more than a demo, he installs it locally. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-06-17.png)

We will be installing it locally per project, because that is the way you probably should do it for all of yoru projects. 

If you don't already have your package.json, create one by typing into the terminal  `npm init`. We will be talking about NPM later in this course, but essentially NPM allows us to download what are called "dependencies", which is other people's javascript packages that allow us to do things. We need other people's javascript packages. We need ESLint, we need Prettier, we need Wes' config. SO in order for that to work, we need what is called a `package.json` file which is going to hold a list of all of the other things in javascript that we need. 

To create the `package.json`, you simply just type `npm init` in the terminal and press enter. You will now be prompted to enter a package name, description, keywords etc but you can just press enter to skip setting those values for now. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-19-18-03.png)

Then we need to go ahead and install all of our dependencies for this thing. Go ahead and copy the line of code in step 2 of instructions to install per project. 

`npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-wesbos`

After about a minute or so, it will go ahead and install all of your files.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-19-20-45.png)

If you take a look at your file system, you will see that there is this new folder called node_modules and inside there are a whole bunch of dependencies. We're not going to get into what that is just yet, that will be coming in our modules lesson. For now, all we need to know is it contains all of the javascript that makes ESLint and PRettier run. 

Next we need to make a new file within the `beginner-javascript` folder, called `.eslintrc`. This is what is called a "dot file". Soemtimes your computer will hid edot files from you because they are typically just files that developers use under the hood. Since we are developers, we do not want to hide those files. If you have trouble seeing that file in your file system, do a quick google of "Showing hidden files Mac" or "show hidden files Windows" and it will show you how to flip that on. 

Inside of your `.eslintrc` file, copy the following: 

```
{
  "extends": [
    "wesbos"
  ]
}
```



![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-16-57.png)


We are going to extend "wesbos", which means we are going to extend all the settings and plugins that Wes has packed into his own config. That is really all we need right now. 


Next, what we need is to get it running with VS Code. Scroll down in Wes' instrucitons to the **With VS Code** section. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-15-45.png)

First thing yo unede to do is install the Eslint package for VS Code. 

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X` will get you to the list of extensions in VS Code. You want to search eslint, and you will see a whole bunc hof different ones, but the one you want is just called ESLint. You'll know it's the right one because it has billions (just kidding, millions) of installs. Go ahead and click the Install butotn.  

Now what we need to do is setup some VS Code settings. Within VS Code, in the right hand corner, navigate to Code > Preferences -> Settings. If you're on Windows, that would be File -> Preferences and then you should see one called Settings.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-18-42.png)

That should open up the settings section in VS Code like so: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-21-21.png)

What you want to do is click on the curly brackets in the top right hand corner: 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-22-00.png)

That will open up the text based version of your settings. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-22-39.png)

Simply just copy all of the settings from Step #2 of the "With VS Code" instructions found on Wes' config file (https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos). Go to the very end of the settings.json file in VS Code, and after the last value, add a comma and then paste in the settings we just copied. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-25-11.png)

Let's go through the settings really quickly. 

`editor.formatOnSave:true`: turns on the format on save.
```
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave":false
}
```

The section above turns off formatting on save for javascript (in another similar setting we turn it off for javascriptreact). 

`eslint.autoFixOnSave:true`:  This tells the ESLint plugin to run on save. If you don't do that, sometimes there are built in plugins with VS Code where they start to clash and they both want to try to fix your code. The built in one on VS Code is called Beautifier and it doesn't do as good of a job as ESLint and Prettier, so what the settings are doing is turning off the editor format on save for javascritp and for javascriptreact and using the ESLint fix on save instead. 

Finally, this is important: if you already have a prettier extension enabled, you want to disable it for javascript and javascriptreact using the following setting:

```
prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
```

Why? Because we are using Prettier not through the Prettier plugin, but through the ESLint plugin. 

This stuff can get confusing and be a real bummer, so if you get stuck or have trouble, watch the video again and check out Wes' troubleshooting tips in Wes' config file instructions. 

The way that you can tell that it is working, is if you now go to any sort of javascript file, add extra whitespace between variables and equal signs and then save the file. 

If it isn't working, you can click on ESLint in the bottom corner and it will often tell you what the issues are with it actually running.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-37-42.png)

Another thing that can happen, is these squiggly underlines: 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-39-39.png)

That is actually ESLint telling you what has happened. If you hover over it, it will actually tell you what has happened. ESLint won't automatically fix these problems for us on save, it just explains what the issue is and then it's up to you to make a decision on how to solve it. 

If you modified the code to be `let age = 100;` ESLint will give you a warning saying you used a let but never modified the value, maybe you wanted to use a const instead. If you modify the code to be `const age = 100;`, the underline under the age variable will be yellow and the warning will say `'age' is assigned a value but never used. eslint(no-unused-vars)`. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-21-20-42-53.png) 

Red is an error, and yellow is just a warning. 

We will be using that a lot during this course. If throughout the course there is a setting you really don't like, you can go ahead and modify the `.eslintrc` file to disable that rule. 

That works by creating a "rules" property like so:

```
{
  "extends": [
    "wesbos"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 2,
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "trailingComma": "es5",
        "singleQuote": true,
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 8,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
 
You can set rules to 2 if you want them to error, 1 if you want them to warn and 0 if you want to ignore that rule entierly. 

If you get stuck, try for about 20 minutes and if you are still stuck, jump into the Slack chatroom and ask for help.

## 06 - Types - Introduction

So far, we have just been assigning values to variables, such as numbers, text, true or false. What are all those things, and what are all of the different posisble options that we have? These are referred to in Javascript as **Types**.

Anytime that you have a value  (a value is something that can be stuck inside of a variable, or passed to a function), it will fall into 1 of the 7 javascript types.

The types in Javascript can be remembered using the word `SNOB'N'US` (just kidding, that is pretty hard to remember).

The 7 Different Types in Javascript are:
1. **String** - a string is anytime that you have some text (you will often see that in a single or double quote or a backtick) 
2. **Number** - a number (regarldess of whether it has a decimal place in it. Some programming languages have multiple types to deal with numbers, but Javascript only has the one.)
3. **Object** - This is a special one, we will go over this one last. Everything in Javascript is an object, and we will understand what that is when we start to hit methods. Everything that we use like functions, dates, and arrays are just objects at the end of the day. All the other types except for object are referred to as the "primitive types". 
4. **Boolean** - true or false
5. **Null** - can be used to set a variable to nothing (we will discuss difference between undefined and null shortly)
6. **Undefined** - can be used to set a variable to nothing (we will discuss difference between undefined and null shortly)
7. **Symbol** - this is a new one  to javascript, and it will always give us a guaranteed unique identifier. This is useful for when you are trying to come with a unique identifier inside of an object and you want to make sure you are not also overwriting something that already exists with that id. 


---

## 07 - Types - Strings

Create a new file called `types.html` and we will use our HTML base snippet. Add the following code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
  <title></title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../base.css">
</head>

<body>

  <script src="./types.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Create a new file called `types.js`, add a console log such as `console.log('it works')` and save the file. Now open `types.html` in a browser and open the console to test that it works. 

 Strings are used for holding text. THere are three different ways to create strings in javascript:
 1. Single Quotes `'text'` 
 2. Double Quotes `"text"`
 3. Backticks `` `text` `` 
 
Add the following to your `types.js` file:

```
const name = "wes";
const middle = "topher";
const last = `bos`;
```

When you save the file, you might notice that our double quotes were replaced with single quotes because of our ESLint rules. We want to disable that, which you can do by adding a comment. 

This is a different kind of comment than this style `//comment` which Wes' has already showed us. The two forward slashes comments out the entire line. You can also put a double slash comment at the end of a line. But a forward slash star (`/*`) comment will open up what is called a block comment. You can close the block comment anywhere you wish to close it (it can be multiple lines). 

To disable the ESLint rule, we will use a block comment even though the comment only spans one line, because that is what ESLint is looking for. 

On the first line of `type.js` add the following block comment `/* eslint-disable */`. Now, if you take the value of `'topher'` and put the double double quotes back around `"topher"` and save the file, the double quotes should remain because we have disable ESLint for the entire file. (It is possible to disable ESLint for just one line.)

What is the difference between single quotes, double quotes and backticks? 

For Wes' Prettier settings, he usually sticks with single quotes or backticks. He has been considering switching to just using backticks entirely. 

Single quotes and double quotes are exactly the same thing. The only reason that we have them both is because if you were having a sentence like `const sentence = 'she's so cool';`, it would break your javascript because the javascript interprets the apostraphy as closing the string. If you were to make that change, save the file and then refresh `type.html`, you will see an error that says 
>Unexpected identifier

 ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-26-09.png)

 In that case, there are a few things we can do. First, we can do something called escaping. Escaping in javascript allows you to tell javascript "No, I actually want this character, don't interpret it as javascript syntax, interpret it as text. Escaping is done with a backslash. For example, change that line of code to be `const sentence = 'she\'s so cool';` and refresh the page. This can get annoying. Another challenge is what if you actually want a back slash in your text? You would have to escape it like so: `'she\'s so cool \\';`

 The other better option is to just use double quotes instead, so the apostrophy doesn't get interpreted as the end of the string. 

Another bummer is sometimes you want to use both, for example let's say you wanted text that said `"she's so "cool""`. You would have to escape the double quotes like so: `"she's so \"cool\"";`

The third option is using backticks. With backticks, you could simply do `` `she's so "cool"`; ``. The only downside to this approach is if you needed a backtick in your string, you would need to escape it like so:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-37-26.png)

That is one of the benefits to using backticks. 

#### Putting String on Multiple Lines

The next thing is putting strings on multiple lines. Let's say you wanted to add the following song as multiple lines of text:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-38-25.png)

You can see that the editor is complaining about the string not being closed properly. How do you do multi-line strings? If you want to, you have to put a forward slash at the end of every single line, and that will allow you to put a string on multiple lines.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-40-20.png)

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-40-30.png)

The benefit to using backticks is you can have multi-line strings and they maintain the line breaks inside of them. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-18-41-29.png)

Sometimes the console will return the value like this `"Ohhh↵↵ya↵↵I like↵pizza"`. Those arrows indicate a new line. 

That will be extremely helpful when we want to make HTML. For example, you can do something like this:
```
const html = `
  <div>
  <h2></h2>
  </div>
`;
```
Before backticks were introduced, the only thing you could use to achieve that is concatination. 

Another benefit of backticks is interpolation and concatination. Let's define those.
**Concatination** is when two or more strings are combined into one. 
**Interpolation** is when you put a variable inside of a string.

In `type.js` add `const hello = "hello my name is. Nice to meet you";`. Let's say we wanted to add our name to the end of the "hello my name is." sentence. 

Previously, with single and double quotes, what you have to do is close the quote, put a plus (which is concatination), and then you put your variable, and then another plus like so: `const hello = "hello my name is" + name + ". Nice to meet you.";`. That is one way of interpolation (using concatenation) (You could do the same thing with single quotes, like mentioned previously, there is no difference between the two types of quotes)

Here is yet another way to do this:

```
let hello2 = 'hello my name is ';
hello2 = hello2 + name; 
hello2 = hello2 + ' Nice to meet you';
```

That is just annoying, because we are just overwriting the variable each time (we are overwriting it with the value of the variable, plus an addition).

Both approaches to interpolation are not the greatest. 

The `+` sign does two things in javascript. If you use it with a string, it is used for concatenation. But it is also used to add numbers (`1 + 1 = 2`).

But if you do `"1" + "1"`, it will evaluate t `"11"`. 
If you do `"1" + 1`, it will evaluate to `"11"`.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-19-02-19.png)

That is ripe for bugs, so that is where backticks come in with a much nicer solution. 

With backticks, you can interpolate the string like so:
```
const hello = 'hello my name is ${wes}. Nice to meet you'
```

The `${}` syntax can only ever be used in backticks. It is the easiest way by far to pop a variable into a string.

Almost anything can go between the curly brackets (`{}`) in that syntax. For example, you can do math. 

```
const hello = `hello my name is ${name}. Nice to meet you. I am ${1+100} years old';
```

Javascript will run whatever is inside of the curly brackets in that syntax (whether it is a variable or an actual statement) and it will return the value that's inside of it.

To reiterate: you can do multiple lines with backticks, variable interpolation, and then there is something a little more advanced that is called a tagged template literal, but we are not going to get into that because we haven't got into functions just yet.

Finally, this will be very helpful for creating HTML.

We can do something like:

```
const html = `
  <div>
    <h2>${name}</h2>
    <p>${hello}</p>
  </div>
`;
```

Now we have all of this html that we have made, and if you add a `console.log(html);` and reload `type.html`, you will see:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-19-12-50.png)

We can actually do something like this with the html we just created (we will discuss what this means in future videos). Add the following code below the html variable:

`document.body.innerHTML = html;`

When you refresh `types.html` you should see something like the following:

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-22-19-15-54.png)

We have just made some HTML! If you inspect the html, you will see it's regular html.

## 08 - Types - Numbers

There is only one type of number in javaascript and that is "number". 

Comment out all the code in `types.js` and add the following:
```
const age = 100;
const name = 'wes';
```

If you refresh `types.html` in the browser, open up the console and type into the console `typeof age`, the console should return to you "number". Typeof is a keyword in javascript that allows you to check the type of a value. You just write `typeof` followed by a space and a variable or value. That will tell you whteher it's a number, a string, or any of the other types.

Numbers in js are pretty simple. You can create an integer, which is a whole number (100), or you can create a float which is a number that has a decimal (100.5). Both are used in the same type of number. 

THere is multiplication division addition and subtraction available to us. 

If you add the following code to `types.js` and refresh `types.html` in the browser, you can perform the following calculations in the browser:

```
const a = 20;
const b = 10;
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-43-11.png)

The only thing to be aware of is when you are mixing types. If you try to do math with a string type for example, you start getting into concatenation. That is what we refer to in javascript as "the plus sign is loaded" meaning the plus sign can be used with numbers to add, with strings to concatenate, and then there is a lot of room to run into bugs. 

If you try to do Math with strings, it will convert them for you if you are doing subtraction, division or multiplication, but NOT for addition. 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-45-10.png)

We need to make sure that when we are doing math, we are dealing with true numbers and not mixing types.

Along with numbers we also have what we call "Helper Methods". 

If you go into the console and type `Math.E`, you will see a lot of built in helper methods. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-49-31.png)

There are four you are most likely to use. One is `Math.round()`. You put a value in between the paranthesis `()`, which is called passing a value and we will go over in more detail in a future video. 

If you give it an actual value, it's going to round it up or down depending on what we have.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-51-20.png)

There is also `Math.floor()` which will give you the lower end of that number 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-51-42.png)

We have `Math.ceil()` and that will give you the upper number ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-52-22.png)

We also have `Math.random()` which will give you a random number everytime between 0 and 1. In a future video we will go over how to get a random number between 1 and 10 for example instead. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-07-52-59.png)

Along with multiplicatoin, division, substraction and addition, we have two more operators which are called the Modulo and the Power. 

Let's take the example of a box of Smarties (a Canadian candy), that you need to split up between your kids. Let's say there are 20 smarties in the box, and you have 3 kids. Let's code this as an example

In  `types.js` type 

```
const smarties = 20;
const kids = 3;
const eachKidGets = smarties / kids;
console.log($`Each kid gets ${eachKidGets}`);
```

In the console, that evalutes to Each kid gets 6.66666666667 
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-08-45-02.png)

That is obviously not going to work because you aren't going to split a smartie into a .6666. 

What we can do instead is we can say obviously it's the whole number of smarties that we need and we can't round up because we don't have extra smarties so that is one instance in which we can use `Math.floor()`. 

modify the code to use `const eachKidGets = Math.floor(smarties/kids);` instead. 

Now in the console you will see ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-08-49-42.png)

Now how many smarties do we have left over? When you can no longer evenly distrube them, there will be some left over (for dad!). How can you figure that out? You can use the Modulo operator to tell how many are left after they have bene evenly split up. 

In the console type the following

`smarties % kids` and you should see the value `2` returned.  

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-08-55-07.png)

How that works is that after they have been evenly distributed, there are 2 smarties left over. The Modulo operator *(the percent sign `%`) will tell you how many are left after you evenly divide them. 

Add the following to `types.js`

```
const dadGets = smarties % kids;
```

Another example would be there are 10 smarties and 3 kids. If you divide the smarties evenly, there will be one left over `10 % 3 = 1`.

Other things you need to know about math in javascript is that if you do `0.1 + 0.2` in the console, it will return 0.30000000004. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-02-54.png)

When people who are learning javascript encounter this, they often think that javascript is buggy. 

Wes suggests trying the following in the browser console:
```
window.location = `https://${0.1+0.2}.com`;
```

That will take you to the following website, that will explain why this occurs in javascript. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-05-21.png)

This happens in almost every language, and that's just the reality of working with floating point numbers on computers.

One takeaway is that if you are ever working with money, don't store it in dollars and cents. 

For example don't do this:

```
const price = 10.34;
```

because if someone gives you a 20 dollar bill, that can run into issues with the long rounded number and you have a half cent and then what do you do with that. 

This is ripe for bugs. Now what Wes does is he stores all of his prices in cents, that way he is always working with whole numbers and you don't have to deal with fractions. When you want to display the price, you just divide it by 0 and round the cents. (We will look at examples of displaying money soon)

Another thing you should know is javascript also has infinity and negative infinity. At the end of the day, there is a max that computers can calculate with numbers. If you try to calculate something that is too high, it will return to you infinity or negative infinity. 

We will go over an example. If you do `10 **`, the double `**` actually means "to the power of". So `10 ** 2` returns 100 and `1000 ** 2` returns 1000000 .

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-12-57.png)

Negative infinity is also a number. Wes has never run into this in his programming, unless you have goofed something up.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-13-15.png)

Another thing to know is `NaN`. NaN means "not a number". 

If you try to do something like 

```
10 / 'dog'
```

would return NaN. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-14-15.png)

NaN is a type of "number", which is confusing since it means not a number. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-19-14-45.png)

That is something you will run into if you try to do math with something that is not a number. Instead of erroring out, it will just return NaN.

## 09 - Types - Objects

Objects in javascript are the biggest building block, meaning everything in javascript is an object. 
Objects are used for collections of data or collections of functionality. 

We will be going through objects in depth in this course, there is an entire section dedicated to them and we will be using objects throughout all of our examples.

For now, you need to know that when someting is an object in javascript, it's becuse we want to group things together. Up to now, we have been using random variables like `const name = 'wes'` or `const age = 100;`. That is not the best way to do things, because the values are not associated. What we can do instead is create an object called person. We will create it using two curley brackets and a semi colon. That is the most common way to make an object, but there are other ways that we will go over. 

```
const person = {
};
```

Inside of the person object, you have what are called properties and values. Add the following to `types.js`:

```
const person = {
  first: 'wes',
  last: 'bos',
  age: 100
};
```

What we have done here is created an object that allows us to group together sort of like "sub variables", meaning that we have first, last and age all contained within an object for a collection that is a "person". 

In the console, if you type person it will return the value, which is the object. 
If you check the type of the person variable, it will return the object type. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-20-25-47.png)

You can expand the object in the console to see it like so:
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-20-27-28.png)

You may notice that the object properties are in a different order then we put them in within `types.js`.  We will go over that after. The short and skinny is that order doesn't matter in an object. If you need order to matter, use an array. 

To access the properties, there is a couple of different ways we can do it. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-20-30-09.png)

We are using the dot notation in the examples above. When we get deeper into objects in the future, we will go over the other ways to do it as well as things like nesting objects and object vs reference and copying objects. 

The last type we need to talk is the last type, which is Symbols. What you need to know about it right now is that it is a way to do unique properties (or unique identifiers in general in javascript). There is more to it, but it's complex and typically used by more advanced users (Wes barely ever uses them) so that is all we nede to know for now.

## 10 - Types - Null and Undefined

There are two ways to sort of express nothing in javascript, and that is with undefined and null. 

If you create a variable and don't set anything to it, it will be undefined. 

```
let dog;
console.log(dog);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-24-20-37-52.png)

Undefined is something that has been created (a variable), but has not yet been defined. 

The same thing goes for properties on an object. If you type in the console `person.dog` it will return undefined. 

Why? Because there is nothing there. That is what undefined is, it comes about hwen you try to access a variable that has been created but not set. If you typed in the console `wes`, you would see an error message returned that said 'wes is not defined' whic hmeans that he has never created a variable called wes. With the dog example we used above, we have created the variable but we have not set a value. That is the difference.

Now we will discuss the **null** type. 

Null is a value of nothing, whereas undefined is a variable that has not yet had a value set to it. 

We will go over some examples to demonstrate. 

In `types.js` add the following:

```
let somethingUndefined;
const somethingNull = null;
```
NOTE: you cannot use a const variable without setting a value.

`somethingUndefined` is undefined because it does not have a value set, whereas somethingNull has the value of null, which is nothing. They are both nothing, but in different ways. 


Lets say for example we have Cher and Teller (both of who are real people), who we will represent in objects like so:

```
const cher = {
  first: 'cher',
};

const teller = {
  first: 'Raymond',
  last: 'Teller'
}

teller.first = 'Teller';
teller.last = null;
```

In this example, cher never had a last name, so she does not have the last property in her object. Teller on the other hand, got rid of his last name, so we are explictly setting it to null.

In the console, if you type `cher.last` you will see the value of undefined returned. When you try `teller.last`, the value of null wil be returned. 

## 11 - Types - Booleans and Equality

The final type in javascript is called a boolean. A boolean is either true or false, it's like a light switch, it's on or off and that is it.

We use booleans for logic such as if statements. 

Booleans can be manually set or calculated. 

Let's take a look at some examples. Comment out all the code you have added to `types.js` so far and add

```
let isDrawing = false;
```

Let's say we want to know if the user is moving their mouse and if they are currently clicking down or up. To do that, we can use a flag variable, which is a variable that is either set to true or false. When the user clicks down, we set it to true and when they click up, we set it to false. That is what a boolean is -- something that is either true or false.

We can also calculate booleans,  so if we have an `age` variable for example that is set to 18, and another variable called `ofAge` that has the value of `age > 19`, if you console log `ofAge`, it will return false. 

```
const age = 18;
const ofAge = age > 19;
console.log(ofAge);
```

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-27-21-39-29.png)


Sometimes values are calculated, like for `ofAge`. We will talk later about the greater than, less than and equal to operators. For now, we will just focus on equality which is the equal sign, double equal sign and triple equal sign.

One equal sign `=` is used to assign a value to a variable.  `age = 100;`

For double equals `==` and triple equals `===`, know that you should almost always be using triple equals. Ther are some edge cases where you can use double equals, but almost all the time it's better to use triple equals.

If you take the age variable in the consoel and do the following

`age === 100` will return true
`age === 10` will return false

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-27-21-56-55.png)

That is what Wes means by booleans can be calculated as well. 

You have 1 value, which can be a straight up value `100 === 10` or it can be a value that is stored in a variable `age === 100`  or it can be two variables. Add `let age2 = 100;` in `types.js`. Save and refresh `types.html`.

Now you can do `age === age2` which will return true.

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-27-21-59-47.png)

What that is doing is it's checking the value of the first variable and it checks the value of the second variable and makes sure they are exactly the same. 

What would happen if instead we did `10 == 10`, with a doube equals? It would return true

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-27-22-01-10.png)

Why are there two different ways to check for equality? Triple equal will check that the value of the thing on the left hand side and the right hand side are the same, AND it will check that the types of the thing on the left and on the right are the same. 

Triple equals will always check for both value and type. 

In the examples above, the types were numbers. 

What if you were to do `"10" == 10`? The console would return true. 
Why?
Because the value is the same, but the types are not. 

If you did `"10" === 10`, it would return false. 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-01-27-22-03-55.png)

This is one of the examples where you can get into hot water by mixing strings and numbers when doing addition. You should almost always be working with the same type. The same is true with equality. It's easy to get into hot water if you are checking if a string and a number are the exact same thing. 

`===` always checks that the value and type are exactly the same. 

In a future video, we will go over something called "flow control", which is about if statements and ternarery and switch statements. These booleans will be particularly helpful for those videos. We will also be extending what we learned here a little bit further into things like truthy and falsey values, as well as this thing called coercion which is where you have a value and you want to force it into a true boolean and what not.
